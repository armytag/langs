## Phonetics

### Stop phonation
- Modal voicing typically requires more energetic effort to produce sustained vocal vibration compared to English
- Thai voiced phones are typically pronounced stiff or creaky during onset
- With stiff voice, vocal folds come together well before release and closure lasts longer than non-stiff
    - Voice onset after stiff voice is very sharp due to the increased tension of the vocal folds
- Breathy voice manifests only during the release of a closure
- Breathy stops followed by vowel display an acoustically noisy but periodic interval as the glottal gesture overlaps with the articulation of the vowel
- Peak glottal aperture occurs before release in voiceless-unaspirated stops, at release in voiceless-aspirated stops, and after release in voiced breathy stops
- Vowels before breathy stops tend to be slightly longer than before modal stops
- Javanese stops in initial position don't have vocal fold vibration during the closure regardless of stiff/slack
    - Arytenoids remained close together for stiff voiced stops
    - Vocal folds are noticably more open for slack voiced stops
    - Acoustic difference manifests at the release, affecting the phonation type at the onset of the following vowel
        - Slack voiced stops cause following vowels to manifest with slack/breathy voice
- Voiceless aspirated stops have a long voice-onset-time before the start of modal voicing for the following sound
- Although there may be no occurence of voiceless phonation, aspiration can be defined as a period after the release of a stricture in which the vocal folds are markedly further apart
    - Timing-based definition of aspiration is appropriate for languages like Hindi which also have breathy voiced stops, grouping the aspirated and breathy stops into voiceless-aspirated and voiced-aspirated respectively
- Relative to modal voicing of vowels, creaky vowels have lower amplitude and breathy vowels have much higher amplitude

### Newar phonology
- i, e, u, ə, a
- /æ/ exists but is fundamentally a sequence of /ae/
- Diphthongs are /ui/, /əi/, and /əu/ with second vowel non-syllabic
- Medial geminate consonants
- Labial stops are affricated when they are followed by /u/ or /w/
- Alveolar stops are dental when occuring after a nasal
- Trill becomes tap intervocallicly
- Word-final nasal with schwa (e.g. /-nə/) becomes /ŋ/
- Long vowels don't occur with geminates (i.e. VːC became VCC historically)
- Medial clusters across syllables include geminates along with stop-stop, stop-nasal, stop-liquid, nasal-stop, nasal-liquid, liquid-stop, liquid-nasal, liquid-liquid
- Vowel sequences əi, ai, əu, au, əe, ui, ae, iu
- Syllable types V, VC, VV, CV, CVC, CVV, CCV, CGVC, CGVV

### Javanese
- No diphthongs
- No word-final consonant clusters
- Word-initial consonant clusters
    - Plain orifice / s, + r
    - Plain orifice (except ʈ and ɖ) / s, + l
    - Labial consonant / dorsal consonant (except g), + y
    - Laminal consonant / s / k / d, + w
    - Nasal, + voiced plosive

### Sinhala
- /ə/ occurs mostly in complementary distribution with /a/
    - /ə/ occurs preceding single consonants
    - /a/ occurs before double consonants or another vowel
    - Only /a/ occurs after /h/
    - /ə/ rarely occurs in initial syllables
- Word-final long vowels tend to be shortened
- Vowel sequences ei, æi, ai, oi, ui, iu, eu, æu, au, ou, ae
- Glides /j/ and /w/ articulated like /i/ and /ə/ respectively
    - /w/ has lips closer together, closer like /v/ than a typical /w/ would be
- Within consonant clusters, the first consonant is pronounced long
- Nasal-stop clusters are special, and depend on the whether the nasal is long or short
    - Clusters with long nasals (e.g. /tammbə/) are like other clusters where the first consonant (the nasal) is long
    - Clusters with short nasals are almost like prenasalized stops and fully joins the subsequent syllable (e.g. /ta.mbə/)
- Word-final long vowels shorten unless word is disyllabic and initial syllable has a short vowel
- Syllable-final nasals assimilate place-of-articulation when combined with a following consonant
- When /w/ becomes preceded by a syllable-final stop, it assimilates to the stop to create a geminate of that stop
- Voicless stops assimilate with following voiced stops to create a geminate of that voiced stop
- Nasals before a word boundary (with or without intervening schwa) become velarized, e.g. /paanə/ → /paaŋ/
- Colloquially, initial or medial /s/ becomes /h/ which can trigger changes of following /ə/ to become either /æ/ or /a/
- Syllables can be V, VC, CV, CVC

## Newar

### Nouns
- Basic form: root + derivative-suffix + inflectional-suffix
    - Derivation from verbal, adjectival, adverbial, and nominal bases.  Most derivation is verbal.
    - Inflection for number and case
        - Unmarked singular and marked plural
        - Many cases suffixes also involve a preceing oblique suffix
        - Cases suffixes for nominative (unmarked), agentive, instrumental, ablative, dative, locative, genitive
- Nominal bases can combine to form compounds
    - Nominal compounds are either subordinate, coordinate, or idiomatic
        - Subordinate compounds are determinative ('one who...'), comparative ('which are like...'), appositional ('green + bird = parrot'), numeral ('two + hundred')
        - Coordinate compounds are collective ('wife and husband = spouse') or contrastive ('water and fire = enmity') *(this seems similar to Mandarin)*
        - Idiomatic compounds have a different meaning from the components ('gold + bird = person from whom one can make a profit')
- Pronouns are personal, demonstrative/interrogative, and other
    - Personal pronouns distinguish between first, second, and third persons
        - Personal plural pronouns are formed by adding plural suffix
        - Personal first person pronouns have clusivity distinction
        - Second and third person pronouns have honorific and non-honorific forms
    - Demonstrative pronouns are third person pronouns with remote and proximate distinctions
    - Interrogative pronouns for humans, non-human beings, and non-beings
    - Interrogative pronouns form the base for conjuctive constructions ('John, who...') and indefinite pronouns
    - Demonstrative and interrogative pronouns form distributive plurals through reduplication of the base
- Monomorphemic numerals for 'one' to 'ten' and 'hundred', 'thousand', 'lakh', and 'crore'.  Other numbers are compounds.
    - Some basic numerals occur after nouns to create a specific meaning like measures of distance
    - Teens are formed by 'ten' + /-n-/ + basic numeral
    - Multiples of 10 are formed by basic numeral + reduced form of 'ten'
    - Multiples of 100 or 1,000 are formed by basic numeral + 'hundred'/'thousand'
    - Final basic digit is added where relevant (e.g. 'three-ten four' for 34)
    - Further structures for fractions are listed

### Verbs
- Basic form: root + (causitive) + inflectional-suffix
    - Verbs derive through auxiliary words, not morphological suffixes
    - Verbs do not inflect for person
    - Verbal roots are monosyllabic
- Verbal derivation can be transitivization or causativization
    - Transitivization occurs through voicing changes
    - Causativization occurs through causitive suffix /-k/ and sometimes additionally another preceding suffix
- Verbal inflections
    - Conjunct denotes first-person subject (occurs for past, non-past, and imperative)
    - Disjunct denotes second-person or third-person subjects (occurs for past, non-past, and imperative)
    - Past forms include a proximate/remote suffix (e.g. verbal-base + past-disjunct-suffix + proximate/remote-suffix)
    - Infinitive denotes a verbal noun
    - Past participle takes an auxiliary verb and denotes an incomplete action
    - Habitual denotes habitual actions
- Compound verbs are idiomatic or auxiliary
    - Idiomatic verbs occur as noun followed by a main verb, and has meaning different from components (e.g. 'head + prop(infinitive) = work hard')
    - Auxiliary verbs can denote permissive, causitive, perfective aspect, continuation, beginning of work, or work in advance
        - When joined with an auxiliary verb, the main verb will be in infinitive, past-participle, or habitual form (with different results)

### Adjectives
- Demonstrative and interrogative roots are basically adjectival in function
- Comparatives and superlatives are by adding specific words before the adjective
- Adjectives can be derived from verbs, nouns, or from other adjectives
- Demonstrative bases for proximate-to-addresser, proximate-to-addressee, remote, and extremely-remote
    - Demonstratives can combine with other adjectives to convey a certain amount/degree of that adjective
- Interrogative bases for humans, animate-non-humans and inanimates (including abstract nouns), and locations

### Adverbs
- Simple adverbs are monomorphemic
- Adverbs can be derived from verbal, adjectival, onomatopoeic, and phonesthetic bases
    - Onomatopoeic and phonesthetic bases are used to convey momentary or continuing aspects
    - Base reduplication can convey repeated actions

### Particles and Postpositions
- Particles can convey emphatic, conjunctive, quotative, expletive, negative, prohibitive, benedictive, determinative, exclamatory, hortative, initiative, responsive, vocative, questions, interrogative, honorific, intensifier, nullifier, and sentence nullifier
    - Conjunctive particles are either coordinative or subordinative
        - Coordinative particles can be cumulative ('and'), alternative ('or'), adversative ('even though'), or illative ('therefore')
- Postpositions come after nouns, pronouns, adjectives, certain adverbs, and non-finite verbs to indicate place, direction, source, method, etc.

### Classifiers
- Verbal classifiers convey aspectual distinctions ('once', 'suddenly')
- Nominatal classifiers denote qualities of the noun, and are used when quantifying the noun

### Reduplication
- Interrogative, demonstrative, reflexive, and indefinite nominal/pronominal bases can be reduplicated to convey distributive plural
- Numerals with classifiers can be reduplicated to indicate distributions ('one by one')
- Classifiers without numerals can be reduplicated to indicate emphasized innumerable distribution ('many of X' or 'many times')
- Verbs in past and non-past forms can be reduplicated to bring emphasis
- Verbs in past-participle form can be reduplicated to imply repeated continuous action
- Verbs in imperative and habitual forms can be reduplicated to indicate more intensive action
- Verbs reduplicated with emphatic particle between reduplication indicates intensified repetition of the action
- Verbs in non-finite form can be reduplicated to give sense of continuity of past-participle incompletive form
- Adjectives can be reduplicated to *reduce* intensity ('sour' to 'sourish')
- Adverbs can be reduplicated to indicate repeated action
    - Final syllable can be triplicated to indicate continuous fast action
- Postpositions can be reduplicated to *increase* degree
- Nouns can be reduplicated with slight sound change (echo) to generalize the meaning ('house' to 'houses etc.')

## Javanese

### Terms
- *Simple words* do not involve any affixation
    - Verbs take obligatory affixation as soon as a formation process starts
- *Composed words* involve an extension of a simple word via affixation, reduplication, or combination
- A *nuclear word* is closely tied to the valency of a verb
- A *peripheral word* is an option word whose function is not implied by the verb
- Some monosyllabic words involve an optional affix or a euphonising appendage
    - There are only a few monosyllabic words in Javanese
- Non-monosyllabic words are usually not more than three syllables
- Expansion of a simple word into a composed word usually only occurs for nuclear words
- Verbs can be combined with verbs or nouns to form new verbs
- Nouns can be combined with similar or unrelated nouns to form new nouns

### Reduplication
- Verbs can be reduplicated to convey brief/informall actions or repeated actions
- Nouns can be reduplicated to convey plurality, affectivity (emphasis), or collections

### Verb specification
- Verbs have inherent features (specification) that affect how they inflect and are interpretted
- Verbs have a certain valency that implies relation to nouns, all of which are nuclear words
    - NOTE: Order of rules do *not* indicate word order
    - State: V → V N(patient)
        - Indicates a state that the patient noun is in (e.g. 'dirty')
        - Non-real states take additional suffix
    - Action: V → V N(agent)
        - Indicates an action instigated by an agent noun
        - Hortative commands take additional suffix
    - Process: V → V N(patient)
        - Indicates a change in the patient noun

        - Indicates a change in the location of the patient noun caused by the agent noun

### Noun specification
- Noun specification as patient, agent, experiencer, beneficiary, or location does not involve affixation
    - Instead of affixation, nouns inherently have certain qualities lexically
- Nouns specify for count, potent, animate, human, feminine, and unique
    - Count nouns can take numerals directly, but non-count nouns need a quantifier
    - Potent nouns can occur as the instigator of an action
    - Some countable potent nouns can be animate
    - Some countable potent animate nouns can be human
        - Only singular human nouns can be pronominalized
    - Feminine is not usually inflected but can be inherent to the noun
        - There is a special case of 'rooster' vs 'hen', two non-human words differentiated by gender
    - A unique noun usually refers to a human noun represented by a proper name, but can sometimes include certain domestic animals which take proper names

    - Provision indicates noun as object of provision/supply via affix
    - Orientation indicates movement towards directions or locations via affix

    - Zero-place verbs denote contextual occurances like weather, and don't need any dummy arguments
    - One-place verbs can be state verbs, action verbs, or process verbs
        - Normal order: N V
        - Emphatic order: V N

        - Normal order: N1 V N2
        - Emphatic order: V N2 N1 (topicalization of verb structure)
    - Three-place verbs usually add an agent to the two-place verbs, but can also involve expansion of a locative verb with a second locative noun
        - Benefactive three-place verbs can be direct or indirect
            - Direct transfer indicates transfer of object between the agent noun and the beneficiary noun, via 'to'

    - Four-place, five-place, and further verbs can be created by adding further location nouns to the phrase
- Simple sentences have a single verb and are an affirmative statement (not a command, question, or negative statement)
- Modified simple sentences are derived from simple sentences by an optional process without additional verbal constructions
    - Possible modifications include negation, frequency, stage, time, question, command, potentiality, or further specification of a noun
- Compound sentences combine two or more simple sentences
    - Identical elements are not repeated
    - None of the conjoined elements modify or subordinate any other
    - Conjoining occurs through a single conjunctive particle
    - Examples of word order with conjunction
        - {N1 V1 N2 N3} + {N4 V1 N5 N3} → {N1 V1 N2 N3 Con N4 N5}
        - {N1 V1 N2 N3} + {N4 V2 N5 N3} → {N1 V1 N2 N3 Con V2 N4 N5}

        - {N1 V1 N2 N3} + {N4 V1 N2 N3} → {N1 Con N4 V1 N2 N3}
- Complex sentences combine two simple sentences where one sentence is embedded in another (called the matrix sentence)
    - Non-state matrix verbs can only take noun complementation, state matrix verbs can take both verb complementation and noun complementation
    - Patient noun complementation via 'which'
        - 'father bury trash *which* be garden' = 'Father buried the trash which was in the garden'

### Speech decorum (registers)
- Complex system of address references, vocabulary, and affixation
- Developed from a complex pronoun system and word-ending variation
- Influenced by factors such as formality, intimacy, respect, courtesy, and status difference/equality

## Sinhala

### Typology
- Highly consistent OV language, with modifiers preceding heads
- Predicates can be verbal or non-verbal
    - Non-verbal predicates do not need a copula
- Clause types classified by verb classes and by number of valency relations
    - Combined with this is an active-inactive dichotomy
- Adjectives do not inflect for degree but take adverbs instead
- More standard identifiers precede variable elements (e.g. family name before given name before title)
- Noun modifiers precede nouns, except for numerals
- Focus can be shifted (emphasized) by moving the focused constituent to the end of the sentence
- Simple questions are formed with question particle or interrogative pronouns
- Negative sentences are formed with negative particles added to the right of the predicate
    - Non-verbal predicates also have other ways to form negation
- Adverbials appear to the left of the predicate
    - Sentence adverbs appear in sentence-initial position
- Aspect and mood always involve an auxiliary verb preceded by the main verb
- Clause combination involves participles, suffixed forms of verbs, and particles
    - Dependant clauses generally preced the main clause
    - Clauses precede the subordinating conjunction
- Although word order is generally SOV, it can be relatively free if there's no ambiguity
- Widespread ellipsis of both subject and object (including dative 'experiencers') when possible
    - Subjects will only be included for emphasis or clarity
    - When a negative marker is present, the entire verbal predicate can be deleted
- Both subject and direct object appear in the unmarked nominative case in active clauses
- Phrases are sometimes repeated with opposite constituent order to emphasize repetition ('he me-DAT hit me-DAT he hit' = 'He hit me repeatedly')
- There are some instances of reduplication, including rhyming expressions reminiscent of Newar echo reduplication

### Nouns
- Nouns inflect for case, definiteness, and number
- Inflection falls into two classes based on animacy
    - Animacy is most obvious in numeral phrases where different number forms are used
- Nouns have 5 cases: Nominative, Accusative, Dative, Instrumental, and Genitive/Locative
    - Accusative is usually optional and is only used for animate nouns
- Definiteness is unmarked, while indefinite nouns take an indefinite marker
- Personal prounouns are classified by person and number
    - Scond person pronouns have three levels of respect/intimacy
- Demonstratives have four deictic levels:
    - Close to speaker
    - Close to addressee
    - Distant but visible to both speaker and addressee
    - Distant and not visible, or anaphoric
- Demonstrative pronouns at each deictic level exist for inanimate nouns, animals (derogatory for humans), and humans
- Interrogative pronouns follow the same pattern as demonstrative pronouns
- Nouns can be derived from verbs
    - Most productive system involves adding particle to verbal adjective
    - Nominalized verb can take slightly different meaning depending on transitivity of verb stem

### Adjectives
- Adjectives occur in three classes: descriptive, nominal, and verbal
    - Descriptive adjectives denote qualities or attributes
    - Nominal adjectives can occur as full-fledged nouns, but do not inflect like nouns when used as adjectives
    - Verbal adjectives denote actions, states, or experiences
    - Nominal and verbal adjectives appear in identical form to the nominative-case nouns and non-past verbs, so they are not "pure adjectives" like descriptive adjectives
- Adjectives can occur predicatively, but require an assertion marker
- Demonstrative pronouns and interrogative pronouns function similar to adjectives syntactically

### Verbs
- Verbs inflect for past tense and non-past tense
- Verbs also occur as one of three types: Active, Passive, and Causative
    - Some verbal stems can occur in all of the three types, but others only create full verbs in a subset of the three
    - This roughly corresponds to a distinction between dynamic/active verbs (Active & Causitive) and stative/processive verbs (Passive)

### Adverbs
- There is an open class of adverbs for indicating time, place, manner, degree, and cause
- Most adverbs are derived from another grammatical category, with a small set of non-derivied primitive forms
- Adverbs can sometimes inflect similar to nouns
- Complex adverbial phrases are created by combining an adjective/noun with another nominal form

### Particles
- Particles are postpositional words without inflection that attach mainly to nominals
    - Case particles connecting nominals to predicate, such as 'by (causitive)'
    - Predicative particles connecting noun phrases to predicate, such as 'throughout'
    - Highlighting particles, such as 'indeed'
    - Conjunctive particles, such as 'or'
    - Discourse particles for textual relationships, such as 'besides'
    - Interrogative particles to form questions
    - Quotative particles after verbal clauses
    - Negative particles

### Affixes
- Prefixes
    - Nouns can be modified, like 'con-' or 'mal-'
    - Adjectives can be modified, like 'very' or 'un-'
    - Verbs can be modified, like 'de-' or 'con-'
- Suffixes
    - Nouns can be modified to denote lexical meanings
    - Adjectives can be modified to denote grammatical meanings like comparative, superlative, nominal sense, and diminutive
    - Verbs can be modified inflectionally to denote verbal actions or verbal objects ('type-writer')

### Interjections
- Interjections are short sudden expressions of emotion, mental attitude, response, or sometimes emphatic effect via reduplication

### Numerals
- Numerals inflect for case, number, and definiteness
- Numerals generally occur as a combination of base forms with particles, suffixes, or measure words
- Lower numerals follow decimal multiples ('100 + 20 + 3') except for teen numbers ('1 + 10', '2 + 10')
- Ordinal numbers are formed by adding a suffix
- When counting animals or humans, numeral classifiers are added to the base before placing it after the noun
- Numerals forms inherently denote definiteness and must be marked for indefinite meanings
- Classifiers appear in singular form while the common noun appears in plural form ('men three-person')
- Measure words are also used with numerals to describe weight, length, duration, etc.
    - Structure of measure phrases is noun + measure word + classified numeral ('bread pounds two')
    - Common nouns can also be used as quantifiers, such as 'bottle' or 'box'
- Two consecutive indefinite numerals denotes alternation between the two ('two or three')

### Kinship terms
- Kinship terms can be extended to the whole society
- Same-gendered siblings use the same terms of address
    - Father and father's brothers all addressed with same term, but mother and father's sisters use different terms ('mother' vs 'aunt')

### Verb morphology
- Verbs are composed of lexical stems and grammatical suffixes to form usable verb forms
- Verbs inflect for tense between past and non-past
- Other finite forms (tied to a specific location in time relative to time of speaking)
    - Imperative mood for commands and requests, usually does not have a suffix
    - Permissive form functions similar to Imperative form but for third-persons (with different suffix)
    - Hortative form functions similar to Imperative form but for first-person plural
    - Optative mood functions like Imperative for first-person, but also changes to intransitive/involitive form
        - A Volitional Optative can also be formed with a different suffix
    - Inferential mood expresses futurity, and is generally used with second-person or third-person subjects
    - Exclamatory mood expresses surprise towards an action
- Non-finite forms are not tied to a specific location in time
    - Adjectival form
    - Focus form
    - Conditional form
    - Concessive form
    - Temporal form
    - Perfect participial form
    - Perfect Adjectival form
    - Reduplicated form
    - Infinitive form
- Although non-finite forms may have past and non-past suffixes, they never express actual past/non-past meaning
    - Instead they depend on the tense of the finite verb for temporality
- Verbs can take passive/intransitive suffix or causitive suffix to change the verb stem
- Verbs can have Active form, Passive form, Causative form, or Causative-passive form
    - Passive form and Causative-passive form are often interchangeable
    - Intransitive stems are transitivized by adding a Causative morpheme
    - Passive forms can be obtained from most Causative forms and function like detransitivization or involitivization
- Basic differentiation of verbs occurs between Active and Passive forms

### Noun morphology
- Nouns are divided into animate and inanimate classes
- Nouns inflect for case, number, and definiteness
- Inanimate nouns inflect for Nominative, Dative, Instrumental, and Locative cases
- Animate nouns inflect for Nominative, Accusative, Dative, Ablative, Genitive, and Vocative cases
    - Accusative case is optional and usually reserved for specific situations
- There are other ways of expressing case besides morphology, such as postpositions and particles
- Nouns inflect for singular and plural
    - For singular animate nouns, a feminine/masculine distinction is sometimes made
    - Number information is sometimes fused with the case information in a single suffix
    - Sometimes nouns add a null suffix (i.e. don't change form) for number
    - Some plural forms mean either genuine plurality ('several mothers') or inclusive plurality ('mother and others')
- Definiteness is unmarked, indefinite meaning must be marked
    - (In)definite suffix usually precedes case suffix
- Nouns can be derived from adjectives or other nouns using suffixes
    - Nouns derived from adjectives inflect for case, number, and definiteness just like ordinary nouns
- Nouns can be derived from verbs using suffixes
- Nouns can take prefixes that affect qualities of the noun but don't affect the lexical category
- Nouns can form compounds, where the head noun appears on the right
    - Only the head noun undergoes case inflection
    - Adjectival compounds ('red' + 'flowers' = 'a certain species of red flower')
    - Numeral compounds ('two' + 'period in the day' = 'morning and evening')
        - The order of numeral and noun is opposite of typical numeral phrases
    - Collective compounds ('fly' + 'mosquito' = 'bugs')
    - Opposite compounds ('take' + 'give' = 'transactions')
    - Rhyme compounds ('car' + nonsense rhyme = 'vehicles')
    - Idiomatic compounds, with meaning unrelated to components ('three' + 'five' = 'blended spice')
    - Compounds are abundant and can be formed with more than just two components

### Reduplication
- Verbs can be reduplicated to perform different syntactic or semantic functions
    - Infinitive form reduplicated to denote iterativity or continuity
    - Past participle form reduplicated to denote iterativity or durativity
    - Past participial form with additional suffix reduplicated to denote only iterativity
    - Verbal adjectives reduplicated to express individuality and emphasis
- Adjectives and adverbs reduplicated to intensify
- Nouns reduplicated to denote graduality, separateness, or plurality

### Argument structure
- Predicate occupies the final position in the sentence
- Constituents are ommited when the referent is understood
    - Second-person pronouns are often replaced by names, titles, or kinship terms
- Argument structure types are classified by the following criteria:
    - Class of predicate
    - Lexical-semantic character of predicate
    - Lexical-semantic character of nominal arguments
    - Grammatical markings
    - Relative prominence of participants
- Possible argument structure types are enumerated in table on page 101 of the reference grammar
- Copula is not required for predication
- Noun phrases that do not qualify as arguments of the predicate are used optionally to modify the predicate
    - Dative is used for purpose, source, time, standard, etc.
    - Instrumental/ablative is used for instrument, duration of time, and various sources
    - Locative is used for location of activity or of states
    - Genitive is used for possessive relationships between one noun phrase and another noun phrase
        - Only used for animate nouns; locative case is used for inanimate nouns
    - Vocative is not used within a sentence but rather to address a referent
- Postpositional phrases convey spatial meanings, and follow their referent
- Case markings do not indicate relations like subject and object
    - Subjects can be in nominative, accusative, dative, or instrumental case depending on the situation
    - For this reason, Sinhala has been described as being ergative
    - The subject is better identified by the focus system (described later)
    - Case marking mainly depends on the lexical requirements of the predicate, particularly theta roles (volitivity)
- When an animate/human noun takes an unaccustomed role (i.e. undergoer) it is marked with the accusative

### Phrase construction
- Noun phrases are connected through case markings
- Modifiers of nouns can be nouns, adjectives, or verbs
    - Word order is critical to interpretting these phrases, with head noun occuring at the end of the phrase
    - Verbal modifiers appear in adjectival form
- Relative clauses are verb-final, so they don't need extra connecting morphemes
    - Relative clauses use a gapping strategy, so there is no overt indication of the relative relationship between clauses (no pronouns or particles)
    - Relative clauses can be embedded within other relative clauses using the case system
- Verb phrase modifiers can occur both before and after the the verb
    - Interrogative particle can occur sentence-initially or sentence-finally
    - Negative particle is added after the predicate
    - Negation of individual segments of the sentence occur before the negated segment as a prefix
- Some auxiliary verbs occur after the principal verb (in the perfect participle form)
    - For example, 'child wet-PAST' = 'the child wet something', but 'child wet-PP take-PAST' = 'this child wet himself'
    - Sinhala reflexives have a strong non-volitional sense
- Certain verbs and adjectives are used as modal auxiliaries
    - Necessitative mood comes from Infinitive verb + 'be'/'become'
        - Animate participants appear in dative form to reinforce non-volitional obligation
    - Deontic and epistemic mood comes from Infinitive verb + 'need/want'
        - Participant in dative form expresses desire
        - Participant in nominative form expresses deontic obligation
    - Ability/possibility comes from Infinitive verb + 'able' with dative subject
- Tense appears as past or non-past, but can convey more nuanced aspects depending on the verbs type (Active, Passive, Causitive)
- Adjectives do not inflect for tense even if they are predicates
    - Instead the adjective is nominalized with dative/instrumental case, and an inflected copula is added
- Non-finite verbs depend on finite clauses for their location in time
- Aspectual distinctions are indicated with Perfect Participle verb + auxiliary verb
    - Aspects include perfective, resultative, completive, inchoative, processive, progressive, and inceptive, all with their own respective auxiliary verbs

### Grammatical constructions
- Valency changing devices
- Sinhala lacks a major morphological passive voice mechanism
    - Involative construction superficially resembles passive structure
        - Use of 'atin' with involative verb form
        - No change in case assignment
    - Inactive/agentless construction can seem like passive
    - Object can be moved to topic position without changing verb tense
        - 'shoe dog eat-PAST' = 'the shoe was eaten by dogs'
    - Object can sometimes be ommitted in transitive sentences
        - 'mosquitoes eat-IND' = '(I am) bitten by mosquitoes'
    - Object may develop from the source concept as an ablative subject
- Sinhala is fundamentally an ergative language
- The 'atin' structure has greater association with ruling out a participant's volition
- Most lexical transitive verbs have a corresponding intransitive counterpart
    - Appears to be minor vowel harmony between the counterparts
        - /bandinəwa/ vs. /bœndenəwa/, /kapənəwa/ vs. /kœpenəwa/
- Causative constructions derive from transitive or active intransitive verbs using the causative form of the verb
    - Active intransitive: NP1(sbj) V → NP0(sbj) NP1(obj) V
    - Transitive: NP1(sbj) NP2(obj) V → NP0(sbj) (NP1(obl)) NP2(obj) V
- Morphological causatives divide between degrees of forcefulness
    - This distinction is largely lexical, and some verbs have both interpretations
    - Passive verbs can have morphological causatives if they don't have a lexical causative counterpart
- Additional levels of causatives can be added with intermediate-agent/causee markers
    - Chitra child-DAT milk drink.CAUS-IND = 'Chitra is feeding the child milk."
    - mother Chitra *by* child-DAT milk drink.CAUS-IND = 'Mother is getting Chitra to feed the child milk."
- For simple benefactive constructions, benefactor appears in nominative while beneficiary appears in dative form
- Indirect causation is only realized through periphrastic causatives
    - Placing verb in inifinitive form and adding a special auxiliary verb
        - 'father trees cut-INF salassə.PAST' = 'Father caused the trees to be cut'

### Expanded sentences
- Compound sentences consist of two or more coordinate clauses which are reversible and enumerable
    - Collateral coordination allow clauses to appear side-by-side without any inflectional suffixing
        - Can involve identical noun deletion, or contrasts ('they work we play')
    - Particles can be used at the end of each clause
    - Conjunctive endings (including clitics) can be added to the end of each clause
        - Perfect Participle (PP) form is often used for coordinating clauses
        - 'mother Ranjit-DAT shirt-CONJ Chitra-DAT gown-CONJ buy.PP give.PAST' = 'Mother bought a shirt for Ranjit and a gown for Chitra'
        - If the two clauses involve the same subject and simultaneously occuring events, the Reduplicated Perfect Participle form can be used for one of the verbs
            - 'Chitra laugh-RPP run.PAST' = 'Chitra ran while laughing'
            - Seems similar to Mandarin *zhe* particle
- Complex sentences consist of one main clause and one subordinate clause
    - Subordinate clauses generally precede main clauses
    - Clauses can be nominalized and then used as noun phrases in the main clause
    - Adnominal clauses are predicates that become modifiers for noun phrases
        - Similar to English 'that' or 'who'
    - Adverbial clauses are used to convey time, cause/reason, condition, concession, purpose/intention, proportion, and manner
        - Subordination occurs through verbal endings, inflectional forms plus particles, and case markers
- Mixed sentences consist of both compound sentences and complex sentences
    - Here is an example of several compound/complex clauses combined using the strategies above (page 204)
        - house-servant-INDF take.PAST-*when* work *do.CONC no.CONC* he-DAT wage pay-*INF* must food give-*INF* must ill b.PAST-COND medicine *buy.PP* give-INF must
        - 'When we employ a house-servant, whether he works or not, we have to pay him a wage, feed him, and buy him medicine in case he becomes ill.'

### Information structure
- Initial position of sentence is generally the topic position
- For existential constructions, location is generally place first
    - 'yard-LOC dog-INDF be-IND' for SOV (Sinhala), 'yard have dog' for SVO (Mandarin)
    - In Sinhala, placing the locative second sounds weird for locative to appear second ('dog-INDF yard-LOC be-IND')
        - This can be remidied with a contrastive particle ('dog-INDF yard-LOC CONTR be-IND')
    - Normal locative can be used with postpositions rather than locative
        - This creates a sense of a single linear exclamation rather than a topic-comment structure
- Focus forms can be used with verbs to add focus to one of the constituents
    - The new focus is usually the object, since the subject (at the front of the sentence) would normally be the focus anyway
    - The subject can be further focused by adding a focus marking particle after the noun
        - The subject could instead be moved to the end of the sentence to indicate focus
        - There are a range of focus-marking particles including interrogatives, emphatic, hearsay, etc.
    - A focus verb form can be used in a direct response to some else in order to question the validity of the other's statement (page 218)

### Deixis
- Deixis is important for integrating contextual information
- Deixis distinguishes between four levels: proximal-to-speaker, proximal-to-hearer, distal-in-sight, and distal-out-of-sight
    - There are deictic demonstratives for each level, which decline for different semantic categories
