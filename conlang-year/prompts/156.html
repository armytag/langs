 Today’s goal extends the focus on creating adverbs in your conlang. Explore options for adverb modifiers, some of which may be basic forms. Specifically, focus on the adverbs (or adverb-like words) that can modify adjectives, other adverbs, or entire sentences, such as degree markers like “very, too, so, just” and discourse-markers like “also, even though, anyway, finally.” Have fun brainstorming ideas and finding inspiration in discovering how other languages mark these kinds of functions.
