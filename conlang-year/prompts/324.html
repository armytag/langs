<p>
 If you created an orthography, apply it to the short translation you did. (If your orthography is a logography, you may not be prepared to write out the full text—just do as much as you can so you can see your writing system in action!) As you work, be consistent with spelling methods, paying very close attention to inflected forms. It can be tricky to figure out how something should spelled, especially if you’re doing a more historical writing system that preserves older forms no longer pronounced in the same way.
</p>
<p>
 If you don’t have an orthography, focus on cleaning up your translated text, getting it to a state you’d be happy to share with other people. For instance, if you translated with everything in a multi-line gloss form, you might create a “clean copy,” where the text is written in your language without any other interruptions. On the other hand, maybe you want to create a version with glossing so you can highlight the grammatical details of your language. Going through the text, you may also find more areas that need to be retranslated or reassessed. You will have some time to focus on those areas in upcoming days!
