 Use today to review your dictionary and all its information. As you comb through the entries, one thing to look for is to see if you remained consistent in formatting, wording, and ordering of information (e.g. make sure all principal parts are listed in the same order, make sure all noun entries have the same kinds of information presented).
</p>
<p>
 You may also want to go through any notes you have kept on words you wanted to create (or words you created but never made full entries for). Take time today to create those entries!
