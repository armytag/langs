 Today’s focus is on documenting the choices you made about verb negation. You may have decided to incorporate more than one strategy (e.g. some verbs use this negator while others use a different one, or perhaps you chose a noun-incorporation strategy that shifts depending on the verb). If so, make sure you remember to include examples of them all so you have them documented in a single place. When providing examples, it’s nice to have write up positive/negative pairs so you can more immediately see the negation strategy at work, such as presenting “He danced with the chickens ~ He didn’t dance with the chickens.”
</p>
<p>
 Remember, too, that if your negator can occur with other inflections, you should show where the inflections occur relative to each other and the verb. For instance, in writing about English negation, I might want to include examples like “He didn’t dance with the chickens ~ He hadn’t been dancing with the chickens ~ He wasn’t gonna dance with the chickens.” That way, I can discuss ordering of auxiliaries and the negator when they occur in strings.
