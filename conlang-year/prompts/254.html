 Sometimes you need to figure out strategies for future translations—write these out so you don’t forget them!

<p>
 If your language will have headless relative clauses (or similar structures), create examples to demonstrate their internal forms and structures and their placement possibilities relative to the main clause structure.
</p>
<p>
 If you chose not to create a structure like a headless relative clause, then show how your language would translate something like “She saw who you pointed at,” “They understand what you mean,” or “Take a basket wherever you walk.” You can use these notes to help remember how you intended to handle these kinds of structures in future translations.
