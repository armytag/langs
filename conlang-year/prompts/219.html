 Now that you have developed strategies for phrasal modifiers of head nouns, the next few days will give you time to actually create examples. If your conlang is a mixed-headed language or has adpositions that developed from different kinds of roots (e.g. from nouns and verbs), you may have both prepositions and postpositions. If that’s the case, make sure you create examples of adposition phrases of both types when showcasing how adposition phrases can modify nouns.
</p>
<p>
 Also, create examples with adposition phrases modifying head nouns in variety of clausal positions—including nouns functioning as the object of an adposition (e.g. “There is a tree near the mouse in a hat”). It’s good practice to work with examples with multiple levels of embedding like that.
