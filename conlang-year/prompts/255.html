 You may consider adding an appendix of features
 <em>
  not

 found in your language to keep them separate.

 Today’s goal is to expand your documentation of dependent clauses to include information on your headless relative clause strategies—whether that means showing how your language forms these structures or providing examples of ways your language might translate such structures without replicating them. However you document it, be sure to include examples and descriptions.
</p>
<p>
 As you look over your documentation in general, consider whether it makes sense for you to move the information on structures
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 found in your language to a different area of the document, such as an appendix. Remember that documenting these features is a way of reminding your future self that you considered them, opted against them, and figured out ways to use your language’s structures to translate instances of them.
