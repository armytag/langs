 Organize/Plan/Structure
</p>
<p>
 Today’s goal is to plan a strategy for active participial modifiers, which are nonfinite active verb forms that modify a head noun. For instance, in “The mouse wearing a hat is here,” the active participial modifier is “wearing a hat.” Notice that, in English, a full phrase like “wearing a hat” follows the head noun while a single-word participial form is more likely to show up before the noun, as in “the running mouse.”
</p>
<p>
 Take some time to figure out how your language will form these participial forms and where they will be placed relative to the head noun being modified.
</p>
<p>
 You may opt to require relative clauses in these situations (or reduced forms, where, for instance, a relative pronoun might be dropped for this structure).
