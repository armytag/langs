 Use today to update your dictionary with the new forms you created yesterday, making sure to expand any existing entries if you added new meanings for older words. As you’re adding in forms, you might find places where you can derive or compound more forms based on what you’ve got. So, if you’re feeling creative today, use that energy to add even more words! They may not be needed for this translation, but any new vocabulary is helpful vocabulary in the long run.
