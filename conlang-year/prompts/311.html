 If you are creating glyphs for a writing system, your goal for today and the next four days is to sketch the shapes that will be the starting points of your glyphs. After this session, you will have days to return to these shapes to evolve them to the glyphs they will be. For now, focus on getting shapes drawn/designed that will be the starting point, whether you are designing forms that will be part of an alphabet, abjad, abugida, syllabary, or logography.
</p>
<p>
 If you are working on translation, then focus your work sessions on creating the lexicon and/or grammatical forms that you will need for the translation.
