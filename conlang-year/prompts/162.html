 These don’t necessarily have to be nouns—they could be verbs.

<p>
 Use your brainstorming from yesterday to make a list of words you need to create in your language to reflect how your speakers view and mark time. You don’t necessarily need to create every time word from your brainstorming notes, but make a list of enough to get you through the major concepts, such as the equivalents of our “day, night, season, year” words. You can always expand the system later, but having some basic forms down will be useful for making more complex words later on.
</p>
<p>
 While my examples have been nominal, you don’t have to mark time with nouns. You could choose to create verbs or constructions that indicate time. For instance, rather than having a noun meaning “day,” you might have a phrase that means “the sun is tall” or something of that nature to indicate it is daytime. Create what feels best for your language, its system, and the speakers!
