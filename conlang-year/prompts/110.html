 Organize/Plan/Structure
</p>
<p>
 It’s another organization kind of day, with a continued goal of updating dictionary entries and checking to make sure all the entries are consistently formatted, labeled, and structured. These are the kinds of tasks we conlangers tend to avoid (or forget or overlook…), but it is really important to keep dictionaries updated as most of a language lives in its documentation.
</p>
<p>
 It helps to actually document a process for how to format dictionary entries so you remember what order you list any inflectional forms in, what specific lexical category labels you’re using (e.g. are you labeling all verbs with
 <em>
  (v.)
 </em>
 or are you specifying
 <em>
  (vi./vt./vdt.)
 </em>
 ?), and what order you’re listing all the elements (e.g. etymology, lexical category label, sources of inspiration). To keep actual labels consistent, keep a running list of all the possible abbreviations you might use in your dictionary—just don’t forget to stick to the same abbreviations as you work on your dictionary.

 If you already know your dictionary is totally up to date, then excellent! Have some fun creating new words and expanding your dictionary!
