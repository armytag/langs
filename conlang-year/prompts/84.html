 Today’s focus is documenting the decisions you made about demonstrative pronouns (or other strategies if you don’t have any such pronoun forms). Inserting a section in the area where you describe nouns and their phrases will help keep that information handy for when you need to remember the work you did this week.
</p>
<p>
 It may make sense to create a table of forms, but it also may work better for you to simply describe what your language does. Regardless of what you do, remember to include examples! Include a variety of examples to show any inflections the demonstrative forms occur with, and be sure to write notes about the translations—especially if your language does something different with demonstratives than English (or the language you’re writing your documentation in).
</p>
<p>
 As with any documentation day, remember to enter any new forms in your dictionary! You are at a point now where you should be able to determine how well your dictionary format is working for you. If you need to make any adjustments, it’s easier to make them sooner rather than later (i.e. it’s easier to do them before your dictionary gets too terribly large). So if you’re seeing any areas of your dictionary formatting that you wished you’d done differently, it’s good to start making those changes now.
