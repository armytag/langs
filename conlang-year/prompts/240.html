 Organize/Plan/Structure
</p>
<p>
 It can be really easy to tweak your language as you work, changing a feature here or a structure there, and forget to go back into the documentation to update the information there to reflect the changes you’ve made. The goals over the next few days are to pause and take some time to make sure all your information on the language is up to date.
</p>
<p>
 For today, focus on the grammar documentation itself, specifically on the descriptions of grammatical features and examples you’ve incorporated. Look for any areas that need to be updated, that need more information, or that need corrected. As you go through your work, compare the older information to the newer to ensure it’s all consistent and cohesive.
