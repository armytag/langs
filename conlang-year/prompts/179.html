<p>
 Today’s goal is to actually create coordinating conjunctions for your conlang and then to put together some sample noun phrases to test out the position of the conjunction relative to the nouns being joined (e.g. between the nouns being joined, after each noun being joined).
</p>
<p>
 You may have decided to focus on one or two coordinative relationships, such as a words representing relationships like “and” and “or.” And that’s okay! You can always re-examine your inventory later and add more if you feel they are necessary, but you may be surprised at just how much you can say with only a couple phrasal conjunctions in your inventory.
</p>
<p>
 You will have more days to work on this coordination strategy, so use today to focus only on joining noun phrases to make sure you have a system in place that you’re happy with before moving on.
