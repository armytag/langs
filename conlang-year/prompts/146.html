<p>
 Today’s goal is to create ordinal number forms, which may mean creating an affix (or word) that occurs with cardinal number forms to make them ordinal. If that’s the case, you may need to create a lexical source for that ordinal-creating unit. It may be so old that it has always been used to indicate the kind of relationship that derives an ordinal number from a cardinal one (and it may be used for other derivations!).
</p>
<p>
 You may also be creating a pattern of use rather than a new form. If you decided that placement relative to a noun determines cardinal-ordinal distinction, then you can spend today solidifying that idea and testing it out in examples to make sure it works the way you want it to. It’s especially good to test it out in a variety of noun phrases in clausal contexts to see how your number forms would interact with other modifiers and in a variety of clause positions.
