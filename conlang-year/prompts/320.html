 Keep moving forward with the work you’ve been doing for the past two days, whether you are focusing on glyphs or translation. Throughout the process, keep taking a step back to look at the bigger picture of what you’re creating to make sure it feels like a cohesive whole. And as you look at the bigger picture, take a moment (or two or three) to admire what you’ve done and enjoy the features you like most about your language and the work you’ve done on it. Remember you are creating some incredibly intricate and complex art—so celebrate what you’ve done!
