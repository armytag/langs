 Today’s focus is documenting the decisions you’ve made about possessive forms by writing an overview, including examples for any different grammatical types of possession you created. Even if you didn’t create multiple types of possession, you should include a variety of examples to demonstrate how one construction covers multiple types of semantic meaning. Remember that your language’s concept of possession does not need to align with English’s (or any other language’s, for that matter). You may want to show how your language uses a completely different construction for some phrases that are considered possessive in English.

<p>
 As I’ve mentioned before, it’s good to explain the examples you incorporate in your written documentation—it not only helps other people better understand your vision for your language, but it can also help remind you later how you wanted to implement features of your language.
