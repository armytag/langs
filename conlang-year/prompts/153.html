 Organize/Plan/Structure
</p>
<p>
 Organize your brainstorming notes from the past few days and make a plan for adverbs in your conlang. Make sure you think about what kinds of words you want to have as basic roots, but also make a plan for more complex ones. For instance, you might map out how compounds that function as adverbs are typically formed.
</p>
<p>
 If you decided not to create adverbs in your language (or to only create a few of them), then your planning will focus on other constituents that can convey adverb-like meaning. Plan out how you might use adposition phrases, noun phrases, or other constituents as adverbial elements.
