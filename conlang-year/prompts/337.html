 Quite often, I find I have the most energy and attention for Lexember at the beginning of the month. Though 31 words doesn’t feel like much when you begin, it can start to feel like a lot as you get into the middle of it—especially if you celebrate any holidays in December!

 If that spike of energy at the beginning of a project sounds familiar, I encourage you to use the extra energy to work ahead. You can make a few extra entries or start laying plans for a new derivation or whatever—whatever might help you push toward the finish line later in the month.
