</p>
<p>
 Today’s goal is to consider whether you want to allow more flexible quoting verb options within your quotative constructions. In some languages, very few verbs participate in quotatives, restricted to a handful of verbs like “say” or “tell.”
</p>
<p>
 Some languages allow more verbs, but the verbs allowed are restricted to communication-type verbs, adding in options like “whisper,” “mutter,” or “yell.”
</p>
<p>
 Yet other languages allow a wide variety of verbs that indicate manner of speaking, emotional affect, or speaker judgment, such as “chirp,” “tut,” or “prod.”
</p>
<p>
 English allows a wide variety of verbs in written texts, but spoken quotatives tend to draw from a much smaller verb inventory. You may want to consider whether your language will do something similar and be more flexible in one genre or another.
