<p>
 Yesterday you explored options for joining clauses together. Today’s goal is to create the strategy (or strategies) you selected for your language and then create examples to demonstrate them in action. If you chose to use the same strategies as joining phrases, then just focus on creating more examples, showing that the same conjunctions that join phrases can also join clauses.
</p>
<p>
 Make sure you provide a variety of examples to incorporate a variety of relationships, such as simultaneous events, sequential events, contrastive information, and options to consider.
