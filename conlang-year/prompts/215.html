<p>
 Use today’s time to plan the structure of adposition phrases that modify head nouns, focusing on the placement of the phrase relative to the head noun being modified. Over the next few days, you will be planning out several different types of modifiers for nouns. For any of these, you may decide that your language does not allow that type of nominal modification but instead requires the use of relative clauses in such situations. If that is the case, work on planning out examples to show how your language would handle something like “in the hat” in the sentence “The mouse in the hat walked through the door.”
