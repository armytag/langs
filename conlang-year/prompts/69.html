 As the final day (at least for a while) specifically focusing on nouns and the grammatical forms they can co-occur with, the task of the day is to review and update your documentation. Go through all your notes to ensure you didn’t miss anything as you compiled information about nouns and their grammatical inflections, and double check all the charts to make sure they are current and have the most recent examples incorporated. Check your dictionary, too, to make sure it is updated with any words or forms you have recently (or not so recently!) created.
