 These may be similar to your non-embedded clause forms or to your relative clause strategies.

 Learn/Brainstorm/Try
</p>
<p>
 Take some time to explore options for handling headless relative clause situations in your language. Some languages (like English) have the ability to effectively use a clause structure that looks a lot like a relative clause in a role that is nominal or adverbial.
</p>
<p>
 For instance, in “I’ll go wherever you go,” the structure “wherever you go” is headed by a wh-word (like a relative clause structure can be) and functions as an adverbial element to indicate where the speaker will go. Another way of saying the same information could involve a standard relative clause structure, as in “I’ll go to any place that you go.”
</p>
<p>
 In the sentence “Love what you do,” the structure “what you do” is the object of the verb “love” and, again, is the structure of a relative clause structure without a head noun. Another way of saying that sentence is “Love the things that you do,” which incorporates a head noun and a modifying relative clause.
</p>
<p>
 Spend some time researching languages that have these kinds of structures, how they use them, and what forms they take to determine if they are a good inclusion for your language. If they are, brainstorm ideas for how they might look and function.
