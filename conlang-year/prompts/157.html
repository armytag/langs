 Today’s goal is to create more adverbs! Create a sampling of degree- and discourse-marking adverbs (or create strategies to show how your language might communicate the same kinds of meanings). You may opt to create basic roots for some (or all) of the adverbs you create, but you can also have some fun with derivations, compounds, or even reduced expressions. As you create forms, it’s good to provide examples in context so you remember how you intended to use the adverbs (e.g. “pretty” can mean several different things, depending on the context in English).
