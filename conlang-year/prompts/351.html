 Another route to consider for creating a font for your orthography is using a software program that can import hand-drawn images and convert them to shapes that can be used in font-making software. Some programs are available for tablets and will allow you to draw in your glyphs shapes directly by hand. Again, these are all just options for you to consider if you like the idea of being able to use a standard keyboard to type in your conlangâ€™s orthography.

 You can always opt to keep your orthography in a handwritten form and import images where you want to display your orthography in a document.
