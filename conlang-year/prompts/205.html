 Take time today to update your dictionary as needed, ensuring your new wh-words are entered. That may also mean entering new lexical sources you used in the grammaticalization process. In your entries, you may also consider adding more specific etymological information, such as defining an original phrase that led to a reduced form.
</p>
<p>
 For instance, if your word meaning “where” originally came from “what path,” you can include that as an archaic expression in your dictionary entry so you can more quickly identify its original source. While listing proto-forms documents their origins, it takes an extra step or two to look those forms up to identify more specifically what a source is. Listing the meaning in the dictionary entry allows you to quickly see what the source is.
