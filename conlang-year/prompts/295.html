 Yesterday you focused on the lexical gaps in your language (or at least those that show up in your translation) and identified which ones you wanted to fill with new words in your language. Today’s goal is to create words to fill in those gaps!
</p>
<p>
 When you create a new word, make sure you consider whether it is best to create a basic root, a derived form, or a compound for that particular concept. And keep looking for ways to use words you already have, such as extending the meaning a word through metaphorical extension. For instance, if you need a word meaning “rope,” you might consider extending the meaning of a word like “vine” to also refer to “rope.”
