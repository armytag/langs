<p>
 The goal for today shifts attention to relative clauses and their structures. Spend your time today exploring options for relative clauses and the ways they can be structured. Don’t feel pressured to make decisions today. You’ll have another day to explore options before needing to solidify any plans, and you’ll have two days to work on that.
</p>
<p>
 Keep playing around with options until you find one that best supports your vision for your conlang and how it works. As you consider options, also think about where relative clauses might occur in the matrix clause (e.g. before noun being modified, after noun being modified, somewhere else in the clause).
