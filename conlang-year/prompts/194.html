<p>
 Document your work on y/n questions by writing a section in your conlang’s grammar. Be sure to include a variety of examples in your documentation, and include example answers to your questions (e.g. “yes, no, maybe”).
</p>
<p>
 As you work, update your dictionary as needed. Make sure you create any entries you need to cover lexical sources for grammaticalized elements used in your question forms, and update verb head word forms, if necessary. For instance, if you created an interrogative inflection that should be listed in head word entries, be sure to update your verb entries with those forms.
