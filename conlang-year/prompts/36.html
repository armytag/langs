 In yesterday’s prompt, I provided this basic template you might follow for documenting your language’s sound information. Today’s prompt expands that to include sections documenting the sounds and patterns in the modern forms of your language, as seen in sections (4) and (5) added here:
</p>
<p>
 Once you have applied the sound changes, how do they affect the consonant and vowel IPA charts? Were any sounds lost? Any new sounds gained? Did the sound changes affect the possible syllable structures in your language? Perhaps new consonant clusters are possible. Or perhaps coda consonants were lost. Whatever the case may be, describe the current state of the shapes syllables can take in your language’s modern forms. Finally, write a description of the stress patterns (or tone development) in your language’s modern forms.
</p>
<p>
 Note that all this expanded information applies only to the modern forms. That is, you should not
 <em>
  overwrite
 </em>
 the information on the proto-forms but instead add sections to show the patterns that emerge in your modern forms based on the sound changes you created.
</p>
<p>
 When you need to create more proto-forms to expand vocabulary, make sure you always go back to the
 <em>
  proto
 </em>
 -sound inventories and phonotactics—not the modern ones. Your proto-forms should only reflect the sound patterns from the proto-stages of your language.
