 Another way to continue using your language after Conlang Year ends is to translate texts you enjoy, whether they are excerpts from books/articles you enjoy, monologues from movies/shows, random sentences you find delightful, or bits of conversation.
</p>
<p>
 If you enjoy writing in your language but don’t want to translate from another language, you can also consider journaling in your conlang. It would be a surefire way to get more comfortable using your language and can help make you more fluent in it, if that’s a goal you aspire to.
