<p>
 Today’s goal is to put your plans into action and create imperative clauses. Provide several example commands in your conlang, being sure you demonstrate distinct forms. For instance, if you decided to distinguish singular and plural in your imperatives, you can show the same command (e.g. “Open the door”) in both their singular and plural forms.
</p>
<p>
 Along with showcasing imperative inflectional forms, it’s also good to demonstrate commands in a variety of verb valencies, such as “Stop,” “Start the car,” and “Give me the cookie.” You might also decide to incorporate an optional inclusion of the subject, as in English’s “You stop” or “You start the car”, or you might assign special pragmatic meanings when the subject is explicitly incorporated (e.g. it might be seen as more polite to do so).
