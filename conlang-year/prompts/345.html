 If you started this month out having decided not to share your work online but now feel motivated to share, go ahead and jump in! It’s okay to do a big “here’s what I’ve done so far” post and then have more regular posts after that. It’s also okay to just jump right in to whatever day it is. I promise you it is more than fine to start Lexember with your Day 10 entry.

 As someone who has regularly participated for 6-7 years now and who follows the Lexember tag online, I can tell you I don’t notice when people miss days or jump in and out. What I do notice is the new entries as they come up, and I am always delighted to see what people have been working on.
