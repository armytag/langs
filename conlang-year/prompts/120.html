<p>
 It’s a housekeeping day! Take some time to clean up your dictionary entries and expand them where needed. If your causative strategy involved syntactic structures, you may need to consider adding argument structure information to key dictionary entries (e.g. adding the causative structure to the verb’s entry that acts as the head verb of a causative construction). On the other hand, if your causative is an affix, you may need to consider adding it to head word forms of verbs if it its form isn’t always predictable. If you created any new lexical sources or auxiliaries/particles during the past few days, make sure those find their way into your dictionary.
