<p>
 Make a list of the words you want to create for Lexember. For now, you just need to list the English glosses (e.g. “skillet, oven, basil”), but if you happen to have already created a word you want to include, then add that form to the list, too. After you make your list with the entries ordered for the month, make sure your template is set and ready to go so you can start sharing your work tomorrow!
</p>
<p>
 Finally, if you hadn’t figured out a name for your language yet, now is a good time to settle on a name so you can share your Lexember words in a named language!
