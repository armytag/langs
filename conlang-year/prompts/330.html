 An orthography section should clearly map glyph form to sounds.

 Today you will add a section to your language document. If you created an orthography, add a section on it, describing its features and how it is used, providing the glyphs and mapping them to sound(s) (or meaning, if they are logographic). You can do all this by inserting a table with images of hand-drawn glyphs. You can always go back later and replace these images with a typed form if you create a font for your language.
</p>
<p>
 If you did not create an orthography, then add a new section of your choosing, such as a section talking about different oral text types in your language and how they affect language features (e.g. storytelling versus court proceedings) or common expectations for information structure in particular text types.
