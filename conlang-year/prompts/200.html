 These words may be related to other wh-words (e.g. “where” could come from “what path”).

 Learn/Brainstorm/Try
</p>
<p>
 Brainstorm ideas for how you will create wh-words that target spatial (“where”) and temporal (“when”) information. If you need to make new lexical sources to carry out your plans, create those today. These wh-words may be directly related to other wh-words you’ve already created. For instance, “where” may be “what” in the locative case (if you have one). Or “where” may be a reduced form of an old compound meaning “what path” or “what place.” If you need inspiration, take some time to explore websites like Wiktionary to see where other languages get their words for “when” and “where”!
