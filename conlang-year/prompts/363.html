 Another idea for using your language after Conlang Year ends is to create language-learning materials, like a 501 Verbs of Your Conlang or a mock Duolingo course for your conlang. This suggestion isn’t to say that you will find an audience of language learners eager to learn your language, but it is a way of digging into your language to find areas that still need addressed. It’s also a way of becoming more familiar with the language yourself. Going through the activity of creating learning materials is an incredible teaching tool for yourself. And then you can share your results on something like Fiat Lingua for fun!
