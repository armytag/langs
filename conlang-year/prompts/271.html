 Today offers a little break between thinking about grammatical forms to give you time to check your dictionary and make sure all the new words and/or forms you’ve created have made it into the dictionary. If you created words to serve as lexical sources for grammaticalized comparative and/or superlative forms, check to make sure those words have entries in your dictionary.
</p>
<p>
 Along with recently created words/forms, I encourage you to check any place you jot down notes. If you’re like me, you may want to check any notebooks, journals, and planners you regularly use for an odd note on vocabulary. And then find any random slip of paper that might have become a space for documenting ideas for words, from backs of receipts to backs of torn-out daily calendar pages…
