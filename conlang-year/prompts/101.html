 Organize/Plan/Structure
</p>
<p>
 Sometimes, creating multiple elements that occur with a single head word can make it difficult to keep track of what goes where and in what order. Now that you’ve created several inflections for your verbs, take a moment to map them out. If both tense/aspect and subject-agreement are marked on the verb, where do they occur relative to each other? Are they fused together in a single affixed form? If so, did you remember to create all the forms you need?
</p>
<p>
 It’s also good to continue testing multiple verb types and forms to make sure you don’t need to readdress any phonological shifts to smooth out forms as they come together.
</p>
<p>
 I find it helpful to create a chart that shows the basic structure of how units are ordered—a templatic structure I can refer to when building forms. It’s especially helpful for nouns and verbs, which are more likely to occur with multiple inflections.
