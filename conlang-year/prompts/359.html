 If you want to create more languages after Conlang Year ends but donâ€™t want to start from scratch, you could use your current language work and start a family of languages. Start with proto-forms for this language and evolve them in different ways to create sister languages. Or use your current language as input for more language evolution to create a daughter language. It is rather exciting to see how you can use the same input and end up with different results!
