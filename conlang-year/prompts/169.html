 What makes a “town” depends on how your speakers live in communities!

<p>
 Consider how your speakers name towns (or however their communities are organized) and spaces within those communities. For instance, you can give a village of speakers a name, but you can also pick out areas that would be important to them within the village and name those, too. You might come up with names for parks, structures (e.g. gathering halls, courthouses, playhouses), or other areas (e.g. town squares). If you have a map of a village, you can fill in names as you create them.
