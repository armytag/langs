 As a final wrap-up on this “unit” covering nouns and noun phrases, take the day to enter any new forms in your dictionary and double-check to make sure all the forms you’ve created so far have made it into the dictionary. As you go through your work, also verify that you are consistently using appropriate lexical category labels for each entry. This is doubly important for forms that can serve as pronouns and/or modifiers, such as the indefinite and demonstrative forms you have created. When you need to refer to the entries later on, it is incredibly helpful for those labels to specify how you can use the forms in grammatical contexts.
