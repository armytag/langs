<p>
 From here on out, the rest of the Conlang Year challenge is the same daily task: create and share a word in your conlang for Lexember. Just don’t forget to update your dictionary as you go!
</p>
<p>
 You can share your Lexember entries via your favorite social media sites (tag them if you do so others can find them), but you could also share them in a smaller community of friends. Whatever you choose, I hope you find a place to share your work because Lexember is all about celebrating each other and our conlangs.
</p>
<p>
 At this point, you’ve created a full, working language, and you’ve got a language document describing its features. So as you share your Lexember work, I also encourage you to consider sharing your grammar document and/or dictionary—perhaps by submitting it to Fiat Lingua!
