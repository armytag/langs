 Today’s goal is to create words that roughly translate as “where” and “when” in your language—the wh-words that target temporal and spatial information. Depending on how your speakers view time, these words might even overlap!
</p>
<p>
 As you work, remember to keep track of what lexical sources you’re using to create the wh-words so you remember where they came from. As you may have seen by now, once forms are reduced, it can be easy to forget where they originally started.
