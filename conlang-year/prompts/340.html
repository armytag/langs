 If you know you will have some busy days this month and are sharing Lexember posts on social media, I encourage you to find out if you can schedule posts for those days so that your entries can continue being posted without you needing to do anything on those busy days. Not all sites offer that ability (which is why I’ve found myself creating hot spots in airports in the middle of a travel day), but it’s super helpful for the ones that do!
