 Create/Make/List
</p>
<p>
 Today’s goal is to fill in the list of forms you made yesterday. Add in any form you’ve already created, and then create the forms you need to finish out the list. These forms might be nouns, verbs, modifiers, or even adpositions—whatever you need to make your place-naming strategies happen!
</p>
<p>
 Not all of these forms will be basic. Take your time to consider which of the forms should be basic (and so can be roots in their own rights) and which should be non-basic. For those non-basic forms, find ways to create the words using your word-formation processes, whether you create new compounds or derivations.
