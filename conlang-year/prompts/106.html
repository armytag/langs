 Today’s goal is to write an introduction to your verb section in your language documentation. Focus first on describing any verb class distinctions you chose to incorporate in your language and then describe any index markers, such as subject-verb agreement markers you created for your language. If you didn’t incorporate either of these features, then provide examples to illustrate how your language doesn’t shift forms to show these distinctions (i.e. show that the verb in “The bear eats berries” is the same form as “The bears eat berries” if your language does not shift the verb to mark for subject agreement). Examples highlight features but can also demonstrate ways your language doesn’t mark certain grammatical features—examples are useful all around!
