 Consider if every clause needs to be tagged or if a single tag can support a long quote.

 Today’s goal is to expand what you’ve done with quotatives thus far and consider ways you might add more information into your quotatives, such as adding adverb clauses, adposition phrases, or relative clauses. You can do this by taking the examples you’ve already created and adding in more grammatical elements, deciding if adding more elements affects the overall expected order of constituents.
</p>
<p>
 Also, expand the quotations of your examples to consider how longer instances of dialogue may affect the presentation of reported speech. For example, if you expand the reported speech into multiple independent clauses, do you need to add a quotative to mark each independent clause of the reported speech? Or can one quotative support a multi-clause quotation?
