 You may have worked ahead in Lexember and want something to do on a daily basis. If you had created an orthography, return to your glyph work. You may need to continue creating more (especially if you have a large syllabary or a logography), or you may want to tweak some of the forms you had so they flow better with the other glyphs. If you didnâ€™t create an orthography but are interested in doing so now, then go to

 to start working on a glyph journey!

 Another option is to adopt an existing writing system to apply to yours, if it makes sense for your conworld setting. Mapping a current writing system to your language is a fun challenge and can give you a way to write your language without needing to create a full orthography of your own.
