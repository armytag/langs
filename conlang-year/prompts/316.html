</p>
<p>
 If you are working on a writing system, use today to explore the writing tools (the instruments) and surfaces (the mediums) available to your speakers as they begin using the early forms of the writing system. What they have available to them will necessarily affect the shapes glyphs will take. For instance, compare trying to carve glyphs into a rock to using a charcoal stick on a fragile leaf. Angles and straight lines will be much easier when carving, but curved shapes that don’t require sharp shifts in direction will help when trying not to rip a fragile leaf.
</p>
<p>
 If you are working on your translation, consider the notes you’ve put together so far and the forms you’ve created. Thinking about the big picture, brainstorm areas you may need to expand or reconsider (e.g. a particular turn of phrase might be better worded as an idiom in your language).
