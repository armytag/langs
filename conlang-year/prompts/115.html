 Incorporate the example sentences you’ve created to showcase your language’s (anti)passive inflections (or other strategy) into your language documentation, being sure to include a write-up about the forms/structures to describe the features in the examples. Using bullet points or numbered lists for your examples helps them to stand out—make sure your language document is a resource that allows you to easily find information about your language and how it works.
</p>
<p>
 If you created a passive (or antipassive) inflection that affixes to the verb or otherwise changes a verb form, consider whether you should add that form to all the head word entries of your verbs in your dictionary (i.e. make it one of the forms specifically listed with each verb’s dictionary entry). If so, work on adding those forms to all the verb entries you’ve created so far and make a note of it so you remember to keep adding those forms to the dictionary as you create more verbs in your language.
