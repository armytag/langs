 Today’s goal is to create example sentences that incorporate some of the names you’ve created—both personal and place names. As you build the clauses, make sure you also follow the decisions you’ve made about how names interact with cases, marking the names with inflections, as necessary. Use the names in a variety of syntactic constructions (e.g. as subject, object, vocative, location) to showcase how the names work.
