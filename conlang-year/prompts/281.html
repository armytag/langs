 Focus first on creating a basic quotative example—a prototype.

<p>
 First, create any forms you need to support your quotative strategies. Then create at least one example of a quotative to create a basic example of how they occur in your language. For today, just focus on a really basic form—a prototype of what you’d expect to occur most frequently as a quotative form in everyday speech for your conlang speakers. You will have more days to expand on this example!

<p>
 If you create any new forms today, take a moment to add them to your dictionary.
