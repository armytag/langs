<p>
 The goal for today shifts the focus to reason and manner wh-words, or words that roughly translate as “why” and “how.” Use the time today to brainstorm ideas for creating those words, which may mean taking time to explore etymologies of “why” and “how” in other languages to find some bits of inspiration. These reason and manner wh-words might be related to the other wh-words in your language, but they may also have completely different origins. They may even be reduced forms of full phrases, such as an adposition phrase.
