 As you consider where to go from here when Conlang Year ends, another option for expanding your conlang is to create a dialect or two of your language. You can apply different sets of sound changes, mark particular words or phrases as dialectal, and create uses of inflections/grammatical features that are associated with a particular dialect. Dialectal variation offers you a chance to expand your language without creating entirely new branches.
