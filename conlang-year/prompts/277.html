 Todayâ€™s goal is to review and update your dictionary as needed. If you have inflectional affixes for comparative and superlative adjectives and/or adverbs, you may need to consider adding the inflections to the head word forms for adjective and adverb dictionary entries. Then again, they may be more predictable, and you may be able to just add a chart in your grammar document to show how they work.

<p>
 If you already know your dictionary is up to date, then create a new word or two and add them to your dictionary!
