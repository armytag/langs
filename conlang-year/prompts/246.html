 Today’s goal is to explore options for forming adverb clauses. These are a type of dependent clause—they tend to occur with a matrix clause, add information such as time, manner, or place. Unlike other dependent clauses, though, adverb clauses are generally not embedded in the matrix clause. Not being embedded means adverb clauses tend to be more variable in their placement relative to the matrix clause, occurring before, after, or even within the matrix clause structure.
</p>
<p>
 For example, in English, you can use any of these three adverb clause placements:
</p>
<p>
 As you explore options, consider the kinds of subordinating conjunctions you may want to create (and their placement within the adverb clause structure), word order of adverb clauses, and adverb clause placement relative to features of the matrix clause.
