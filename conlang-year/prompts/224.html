 Your language may treat these as two distinct clause structures.

 Organize/Plan/Structure
</p>
<p>
 Select the strategy for creating noun clause structures in your language, specifically those that follow cognition and communication verbs. Or select more general clausal strategies for translating instances where a noun clause might occur in another language but does not in yours.
</p>
<p>
 For instance, if you need to translate something like “I think that they are arriving tomorrow,” consider how your language would handle that structure. It could be achieved in other ways, such as clausal chaining, so you don’t have to incorporate a specific subordinate clause strategy for these instances. But you do need to identify how your language will handle them.
