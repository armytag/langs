 Learn/Brainstorm/Try
</p>
<p>
 Today’s goal builds on yesterday’s explorations by adding superlative adverb forms. Consider how your language might express meanings like “The bear jumped farthest” or “The duck swam most quickly.”
</p>
<p>
 Manner adverbs are most likely to participate in comparative/superlative constructions, but that doesn’t mean other adverbs can’t (e.g. “farther, farthest”).
</p>
<p>
 Today is all about exploration and brainstorming!
