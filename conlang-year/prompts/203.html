 Today’s goal is to create the wh-words you’ll need to target manner and reason information in questions. As you work, make sure you select a system that makes sense with your larger vision for your language. For instance, you may find that, given the lexical sources you’ve selected, it makes sense to have more than one form that translates as “how,” such as a form representing the specific manner in which something was done (e.g. joyfully, in a hurry) versus the way in which they accomplished something (e.g. with a hammer).

 Also create questions to showcase your new wh-words in a variety of examples!
