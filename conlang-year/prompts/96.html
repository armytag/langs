 It’s an organizational day! Today is set aside for organizing your notes on your ideas for verb inflections so far to prepare for the upcoming days where you’ll be creating the forms (or other strategies, such as specific word orders or set constructions) for your initial verb inflections. As you think through any lexical sources you need to grammaticalize inflections, remember that the semantics of your lexical sources will affect the placement of the inflection relative to the verb (whether it occurs as an auxiliary, particle, or affix). Take time to consider the semantics of your choices and to consider your decisions as a whole to ensure your system feels cohesive.
