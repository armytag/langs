 These include “who, what, which, whose” and any others needed for your inflectional system.

<p>
 Today’s goal is to create wh-word forms for your conlang that will allow you to question information within a noun phrase, such as “who, what, which, whose.” What wh-words you need specifically will depend on your conlang  system and the strategies you’ve selected based on your brainstorms. For instance, you may only need one wh-pronoun, where a single form might be translated as “what” or “who,” depending on context. On the other hand, you may need a handful of wh-pronouns that target more specific noun classes, or you may need different forms to reflect your language’s case-marking system.
</p>
<p>
 If you selected a strategy that requires other marking, such as an interrogative particle or inflection, then you will need to create that, too. As you work, make sure your choices are consonant with the system you’ve set up for your language so far.
