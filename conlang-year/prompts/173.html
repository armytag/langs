 Today’s goal is to use everything you’ve made so far to support creating names and actually create some personal names in your language for your speakers. You can, of course, create as many as you’d like, but my advice is to start small and make sure you create names that showcase your strategy/strategies. The more diverse examples you have, the better you’ll remember your naming intentions down the road when you need/want to create more names for your speakers. This is an exciting step in the world-building process, so have some fun with it!
