 Now that you have done a lot of work on adverbs, it’s time to document their forms. Remember to include information on all the kinds of adverbs (or adverb-like forms) in your language—it can be helpful to actually create different subsections for spatial, temporal, manner, degree, and discourse adverbs to make the information easily accessible.
</p>
<p>
 In your write-up, remember to include information about how they are formed for any adverb that is not a basic root, showing examples as you write about them. Also include basic placement information, such as whether a manner adverb is more likely to occur before or after the verb in a clause.
