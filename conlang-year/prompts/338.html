 Even if you created a template for your entries, if you are working on an entry and want to include different information, don’t feel beholden to your original designs. There’s nothing keeping you to a particular design or set of information for these entries! Maybe you created a word that has a cool origin story, and you want to focus on etymology instead of other information. Maybe you got an idea for a drawing to accompany a particular word but hadn’t used images in other entries. Whatever the case, feel free to change things up when a creative spark hits!
