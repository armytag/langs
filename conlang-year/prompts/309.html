<p>
 The goals over the next few weeks will be split in half. Some of you will be creating a writing system, so you need to focus on those goals. However, if you are not creating a writing system for your language, then focus on the translation prompts.
</p>
<p>
 For all the writing system folks, make a plan for your writing system by selecting its type (i.e. alphabet, abjad, abugida, syllabary, logography) and outlining a general plan for mapping sounds-to-symbols. Make sure the writing system you’ve selected will work well with your language and its sound system.
</p>
<p>
 If you’re working the translation of the original text you wrote, take time to set the text up in a working space that will help you stay organized as you move forward. It may help to break the text apart to get it ready for interlinear notes. Or you may want to copy it into different documents to allow yourself to make notes as needed on separate copies. However you work best, set your work flow up so you’re ready for the translation.
