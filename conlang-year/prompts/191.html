<p>
 Today’s focus shifts to negative y/n questions, such as “Didn’t you see the mouse?” or “Isn’t that bread baked yet?” Create example negative y/n questions for your language, which may mean creating a negative y/n interrogative particle, auxiliary, or inflection.
</p>
<p>
 As you work, you can consider what kinds of situations would prompt your speakers to use a negated y/n question rather than a positive one. Sometimes, negated y/n questions indicate the speaker believes the information is or
 <em>
  should
 </em>
 be true. Asking “Didn’t you see the mouse?” in English indicates that the speaker thinks the person
 <em>
  should
 </em>
 have seen the mouse, and an answer of “no” has a bit of a surprisal factor.
</p>
<p>
 You can decide if you want to build in a similar kind of feature into your language for when speakers choose to negate these question forms.
