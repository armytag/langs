<p>
 Now that you have created several types of indefinite pronouns (and modifiers), today’s focus is on documenting those forms and their uses by writing a description in your language’s grammar. As always, make sure you use examples! As you provide examples, describe them so you can more easily remember what is special about any forms and the ways they are used in context.
</p>
<p>
 Another feature to consider is whether these forms interact with case, such as taking case inflections in the same way nouns do (if your nouns occur with case inflections) or requiring a particular case on a noun occurring with an indefinite modifier (e.g. using the partitive case on a noun occurring with the modifier
 <em>
  some
 </em>
 ).
</p>
<p>
 As you make these decisions, be sure to document them in your grammar.
