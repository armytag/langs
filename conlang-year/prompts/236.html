 Today’s goal is to explore ways verbs can function as nouns, including gerunds (e.g. “Baking relaxes me”), fuller gerund phrases (e.g. “Baking cupcakes relaxes me”), and reduced clause forms (e.g. “We watched the sun setting over the ocean”). The distinction among these is how much can be incorporated with the verb while serving as a nominal element. In general, these forms are referred to as gerunds, though linguists use other terms depending on the language being described and the theoretical approach taken in the description.
