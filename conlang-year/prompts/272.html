 </strong>
 You can consider adverbs how adverbs might be comparative, like “more quickly.”

   Tip:

 </strong>
 You may use the same forms/constructions, create different ones, or disallow adverbs to participate in such a construction.

 Learn/Brainstorm/Try
</p>
<p>
 Today’s goal is to brainstorm options for comparing adverbs, especially manner adverbs, in instances like “The dancer leapt more gracefully” or “The rabbit ran faster.” Explore how other languages (especially languages with patterns similar to yours) express comparative adverb meanings, whether they have comparative inflections for adverbs or set periphrastic constructions—or lack a dedicated structure but instead express the meaning in other ways.
</p>
<p>
 Even if you have comparative forms for adjectives, you don’t necessarily need to use the same ones for adverbs, and you may decide not to allow adverbs to participate in comparative constructions at all.
</p>
<p>
 Have some fun exploring options and thinking about what makes sense for your language.
