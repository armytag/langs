<p>
 Yesterday’s focus was on selecting which inflections should be included in the dictionary entries (e.g. as part of the head word). Today’s goal is to actually make that happen! Go through your dictionary, and, for every noun included, provide the inflected forms you selected.
</p>
<p>
 However you choose to show the inflected forms, it is quite helpful to be consistent in formatting so you can easily look at an entry and identify the information you need. Consistency includes listing inflected forms in the same order for all the entries, using the same conventions when listing forms (e.g. using hyphens for affixes), and providing any other information in the same order and manner.
</p>
<p>
 If you don’t have any inflected forms you need to list in the dictionary, it is still good to go through your dictionary and check to make sure all the entries are formatted similarly and include all the same types of information so far.
