 </strong>
 If you’ve been working on orthography, return to the very short text you wrote; if needed, shorten it!

<p>
 If you had already been working on translation, keep up you work and get the final bit of translation done today!
</p>
<p>
 If you had been working on orthography, go back to the very short text you created for your language (see Day 308) and translate it. The goal is for this text to be so short you can do the translation all in one day. So if you start work and realize it’s a bit too much, shorten the text so it’s manageable. The goal of this translation is to give you a break from glyph work and a text to work with to practice applying your orthography (in a couple days you’ll write this text using your newly developed glyphs!).
