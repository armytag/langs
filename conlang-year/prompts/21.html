 The vocabulary creation continues! Today’s prompt asks you to create proto-forms for weather phenomena in your conworld, beginning with the most prominent weather patterns your speakers might experience. Languages differ in whether words referring to weather tend to be nouns, verbs, or both. You don’t need to decide how the forms you’re creating are going to be grammatically used just yet. You can, for instance, create a form meaning “rain” and then decide later, when you’re working on more specific grammatical features, whether you want that form to be used as a noun, referring to rain or raindrops, or as a verb, referring to the act of raining. Figuring out how you want to use weather words in context can provide a fun exercise in creating colloquial constructions and idiomatic expressions down the road.
