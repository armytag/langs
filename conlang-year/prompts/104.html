 Create/Make/List

<p>
 Build on what you did yesterday, and actually create your negation strategies, whether that means creating new forms, grammaticalizing existing words, or creating a new column in a chart or two to show how the negative is formed. After you have what you need created, return to the sentences you created a few days ago, and negate them to see how everything works out. The more you test the forms, the more you can be sure itâ€™s going to work for you moving forward!
