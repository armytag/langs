<p>
 Most of the prompts this month target two major tasks: a writing system (if you are developing one) and translation of an original text that you write for your speakers. I use the term “text” in its broader sense. While it will be written down for the purposes of this translation activity, it may be an oral text in your language. Today’s goal is to write the text that you will be translating.
</p>
<p>
 If you are going to create a writing system for your language, keep this text on the shorter side (e.g. a very short paragraph). However, if you are not developing a writing system, then you will have nearly three weeks to spend on this translation, so you can make it longer and more complex.
</p>
<p>
 You can make the text anything you want it to be, but if you’re struggling to get ideas, you might consider writing a creation myth, parable/fable, story of an important figure in your conworld, biography of a speaker, or even an encyclopedic entry of a particular type of flower that grows in your conworld.
