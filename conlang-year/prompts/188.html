<p>
 It’s time to start thinking about questions! The first focus is on yes/no questions, or questions that can be answered with a simple “yes” or “no.” These are distinct from wh-word questions (or content questions), which require at least a single word to answer. For instance, “Have you seen my dog?” is a y/n question while “What is your dog’s name?” is a wh-word question.
</p>
<p>
 Take some time to explore options for forming y/n questions that feel right for your language. Options you might consider include a word order shift (e.g. an SVO language may signal that a clause is a question by fronting the verb with VSO order), the addition of a y/n particle (often at a clause boundary) that signals a clause should be interpreted as a question, and/or an interrogative inflection that co-occurs with the verb (whether it is marked on the verb as an affix or occurs as an auxiliary).
</p>
<p>
 Only focus on y/n questions for now as you explore options!
