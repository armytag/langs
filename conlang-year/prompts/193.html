<p>
 Now that you have y/n question forms, today’s goal is to create strategies for answering them. The most common answers you might need are “yes,” “no,” and “maybe” or some way of saying “I don’t know” or “I’m not sure.”
</p>
<p>
 Although “yes” and “no” are small forms in many languages, they can be complex in their histories. For instance, “yes” may be a reduced form based on a phrase meaning “it is true” or “so it goes.” These words are an opportunity to consider cultural associations for your speakers, thinking about ways they verify or deny information on a regular basis.
