<p>
 You’ve spent time exploring and planning the structures of adverb clauses. Today’s goal is to create your first examples of sentence structures that incorporate these clauses. Focus on creating simple examples to demonstrate placement options for adverb clauses relative to constituents in the main clause and the basic structures of adverb clauses.
</p>
<p>
 To create these clause structures, you may need to take a step back and first actually create subordinating conjunctions in your language. Another part of today’s goal is to demonstrate where those occur in the adverb clause structure and how they operate generally.
</p>
<p>
 You will have more time to create clauses tomorrow, so use today to get started with adverb clauses and to get a few examples on paper.
