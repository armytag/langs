 If you can’t finish them all, don’t fret. Keep good notes on your work so you’re set up to finish them later!

 If you are working on glyphs, today is the final day set aside for glyph evolution. That doesn’t mean you will necessarily finish all the glyphs you need—if you’re working on a pure syllabary or logography, you may need a lot more time! Set yourself up for getting future work done on the system by keeping good notes on your work and keeping all the forms you’ve created in a place where you can find them all again (don’t lose track of where you drew/created these glyphs!). That way, on any day that you have extra time, you can dip back into the glyphs and work on one or two here or there to keep expanding your system.

 If you are working on translation, work on the fourth section of your original text translation. You will have one more day set aside for translation!
