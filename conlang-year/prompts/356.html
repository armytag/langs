 We are wrapping up the first three weeks of Lexemberâ€”you are so close to the end of the month (and the year)! Reassess where you are in terms of how you feel about the work and your progress toward the end of the event. If you need to, change your process or work flow, especially as we move into the end of the month where you may have more holidays, gatherings, end-of-year celebrations, etc. Do what works for you!
