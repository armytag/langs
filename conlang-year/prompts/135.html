 It’s a cleaning day! Use today to clean up your documentation and update your dictionary, making sure you create dictionary entries for any adjective (or other modifier) you created. As you enter the forms, consider whether you need to include any inflections in the head entries (e.g. agreement inflections if your adjectives agree with head nouns). Remember to check any notebooks or sketchpads or scratch paper you have used to outline modifiers in your language to see if you have any forms floating around that you brainstormed but haven’t yet documented. Sometimes I find that I forget to double-check my handwritten notes, where I’ve jotted down a great idea for a new word or concept. So find all those scraps with brilliant ideas and make sure they’re included in your language documentation!
