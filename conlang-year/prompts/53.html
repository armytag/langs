 It’s time to formalize all your nominal inflection decisions and update your language’s documentation. I’ve broken this up into a four-day process to give you time to write about each area and provide ample examples as you describe the features. Today’s focus is writing an introduction to noun classes.
</p>
<p>
 If you haven’t already created a table to demonstrate forms, you may want to take time to do that today. If the inflections are clitics or affixes, it’s good to show a table with a variety of nouns with different phonological shapes, such as a consonant-initial noun, vowel-initial noun, consonant-final noun, and vowel-final noun.
</p>
<p>
 Even if you don’t have noun classes (or other inflections in coming days), make sure you indicate that your language does not have them and provide examples. If you do have these inflections, it’s good to create charts to showcase them, especially showing how they look when attached to bases with different phonological forms.
