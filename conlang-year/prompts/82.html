<p>
 Demonstrative pronouns differ from demonstrative modifiers in that they stand alone. In English, the modifier and pronoun forms are identical, so it’s difficult to see any difference when “those” is used as a pronoun or a modifier, as in these sentences.
</p>
<p>
 In some languages, the forms will differ between these two contexts. (Though those different forms will frequently still be related to each other, making it possible to see a connection between them.)
</p>
<p>
 Consider your pronoun system as a whole when you make this decision. If you don’t have any third-person personal pronouns, then you should consider having demonstrative pronouns. I’m really hedging there. If your goal is a naturalistic conlang, then not only should you
 <em>
  consider
 </em>
 this, but you really
 <em>
  should
 </em>
 have demonstrative pronouns. The demonstrative pronouns can then be used when a third-person pronoun is needed, such as saying “I carried those” or “I carried these” anytime you need to say “I carried them.”
