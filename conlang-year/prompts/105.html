 Today begins a four-day focus on officially documenting all the inflections you’ve created for your verbs, beginning with creating any inflectional charts (or series of charts) that can illustrate various grammatical forms of your verbs or auxiliaries that co-occur with verbs. If you don’t feel you need any charts, be sure to spend time getting all your information in one place to get ready for the upcoming days, which focus on actually writing up sections describing your verbs and their inflectional forms.
