 Today’s goal is to review and update your dictionary as necessary to add any new words you’ve created as you worked on quotatives. Rather than adding new words, you may need to expand the definitions and/or grammatical descriptions of verbs that occur within quotatives. If you have a smaller subset of verbs allowed within quotatives, you may even want to make special definitions for that particular grammatical use of the verb.
</p>
<p>
 If your dictionary is set, you can always use the day to create a new word or two to add them to your dictionary!
