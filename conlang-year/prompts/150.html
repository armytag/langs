<p>
 Today the focus shifts to adverbs! Consider possibilities for spatial adverbs in your language, starting with basic forms like “here” and “there.” Some adverbs might be compounded or derived, such as “inside, outside, upwards.” As you explore options, think about how many basic spatial adverbs you want in your language and whether you want compounded/derived spatial adverbs. You can think about having fewer adverbs to rely on other constructions, such as adposition phrases. Have some fun brainstorming and exploring what other languages do to get ideas for how you want to approach them in your language!
