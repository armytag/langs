 Another verbal area to explore is evidential markers. These markers indicate how the speaker knows the information in the clause. A common evidential system indicates whether the speaker knows the information firsthand (they have direct evidence for what they’re saying) or has surmised, heard, or otherwise gleaned the information in other ways.
</p>
<p>
 More complex evidential systems may mark if the speaker knows the information from direct visual evidence, aural evidence, or has good reason to believe the truth of the information without knowing it directly.
</p>
<p>
 Spend your time today exploring options to consider whether you will mark evidentiality through some sort of inflection. Remember you don’t need to incorporate these as inflections—the same kind of information can be provided through verb choice (e.g. “I think it rained” versus “I know it rained”).
