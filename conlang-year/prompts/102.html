 Take your verbs out for a spin! Have some fun creating more clause structures in your language—these will be handy additions to your language’s grammar when we get to the documenting days. (Example sentences are always good to have in plenty!) As you create clauses, make sure you’re happy with how your verbs are shaping up, especially if multiple inflections occur with a single form. If they attach as affixes, also double check any sound changes that might be affected by the affixations.
</p>
<p>
 For right now, all these sentences should be basic clause structures that are declarative (i.e. making statements). They should also be in the active voice (we’ll get to passive strategies soon!) and should be positive (i.e. no negated verbs yet). Tomorrow you’ll start working on negating verbs, so you’ll be able to turn these clauses negative in a few days, should you choose to do so.
