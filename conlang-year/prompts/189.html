 Organize/Plan/Structure
</p>
<p>
 Select a strategy for creating y/n questions. You may need to consider having multiple strategies if you have different syntactic verb types that would operate differently as y/n questions. However, you may also just have a single strategy that works for turning any given clause into a y/n question.
</p>
<p>
 Another area to consider is that languages may have different structures and pragmatic expectations for positive and negative y/n questions. For languages that operate like English, a positive question like “Have you seen my book?” is more pragmatically neutral while the negative “Haven’t you seen my book?” carries an expectation that the speaker thinks the answer should be “yes.”
</p>
<p>
 Plan out your strategy and list any forms you need to create to carry out your plans.
