 Some conlangers focus on one language and really build it up over years. If that is appealing to you, then once Conlang Year ends, your journey with this language is just beginning. Now that you have its foundation, you can continue growing it and using it in new ways.
</p>
<p>
 Other conlangers enjoy the language creation process so much that they keep going—they keep creating new languages, new language sketches, new ideas for a potential future language… If that’s appealing to you, then you might consider starting a new language after this one. You can even go through Conlang Year again, starting with a whole new idea!
