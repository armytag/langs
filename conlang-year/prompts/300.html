 Today’s goal is to translate the second section of the text. As you work, keep looking for areas where you might shift the wording or phrasing in your language to better fit its linguistic features or its speakers and their world.
</p>
<p>
 If you realize a section is harder than you had originally anticipated when you first divided the text, feel free to change how you had divided it up at first! There’s no need to strictly adhere to your original sections.
