 Organize/Plan/Structure
</p>
<p>
 Use your time today to plan out your strategies more specifically for (1) noun clauses that function in subject roles, (2) gerunds (verb forms that function as nominal elements), and (3) non-finite reduced clause forms that are more grammatically complex in nominal roles. Your language may have all three of these but may also have none of them or fall somewhere in between.
</p>
<p>
 For whatever forms you allow in nominal roles, create templates to demonstrate their structures, and create any new forms you need to support those structures (you may not need any!).
</p>
<p>
 If you are not allowing any of these forms, plan out strategies for how youâ€™d handle translating such sentences as those presented as examples in the past few days.
