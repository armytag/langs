 The second week of Lexember has officially begun. Take a moment to reassess where you are and how it’s going for you. Be honest in your evaluation. This month should be fun—not a chore. If it’s feeling like a chore, consider how you might change things up so they work better for you. Find ways to focus on the areas that “spark joy” for you and celebrate them in your work!
