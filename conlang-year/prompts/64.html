 Now that you have written a section on adpositions and their use in your language, you need to take time to enter any adpositions you created in your dictionary. Each adposition should have its own entry so you can keep track of meanings and any specific grammatical information you need to note about its use, such as an adposition requiring a noun to occur with particular case-marking.
</p>
<p>
 As you are updating your dictionary, also double-check to make sure you entered any lexical sources you created for your adpositions. For instance, if you created a new verb to serve as a source for an adposition, make sure you create a dictionary entry for that verb. If you created any new nouns, make sure you follow the conventions you already established for noun entires (e.g. providing inflectional forms).
</p>
<p>
 By the end of todayâ€™s work, your dictionary should be up-to-date and ready for more lexical expansion in the coming weeks!
