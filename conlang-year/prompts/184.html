 You might consider using the bare/citation form of the verb with no explicit subject.

<p>
 Now that you have had some fun exploring imperatives, select a strategy or set of strategies that you want to incorporate into your language. Make sure you think of your language as whole system and select something that works with the other verb inflections and clausal constructions you’ve already selected. As you draft your plan, make a list of any forms you need to create or forms you need to compile to complete your chosen strategy.
</p>
<p>
 Remember that sometimes inflections are represented by bare forms. In some languages, imperative clauses use a bare (or citation) form of the verb without any explicit subject—the addressee (i.e. a second-person referent) is implied by the clausal construction.
</p>
<p>
 If you decide to have several distinctions made within imperatives, make sure you make a plan for all of them!
