 Learn/Brainstorm/Try
</p>
<p>
 Expand your brainstorming on wh-questions by exploring options for wh-words as modifiers for a head noun, such as “which car” or “what mouse” or “whose sweater”. Depending on your language and how it works, these words may act as determiners, possessives, and/or modifiers.
</p>
<p>
 As you generate ideas, make sure you consider how these forms will occur when supporting head nouns in a variety of clausal positions (e.g. “which car” as subject, object, object of adposition).
