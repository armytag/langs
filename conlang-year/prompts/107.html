 Today continues work on language documentation, focusing on describing how your language handles tense/aspect distinctions. Even if your language lacks any T/A-specific inflections, your speakers will still have a way of indicating the same kind of information (e.g. through the use of temporal adverbs to indicate something is finished or forthcoming). The goal is to detail what you’ve created for your verb system well enough that you will be able to understand the features and use them in the language even if it’s been five years since you’ve touched the project. So be kind to Future You as you explain your system!
