 Keep reassessing the glyphs as a system—they should feel like they belong together!

<p>
 For those working on orthography, keep evolving original images into glyph forms. As you work continue to take a step back, so to speak, and look at the system as a whole to ensure the glyphs look like they belong to the same writing system. It should feel like you are creating a system rather than disparate shapes.
</p>
<p>
 For those working on translation, move on to the next section you’ve marked for translation. As you work on this section, take a moment to read through what you did yesterday with today’s work to make sure it feels like the text is cohesive.
