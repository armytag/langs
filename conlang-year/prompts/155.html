 Today’s focus is on creating examples of adverb (or adverb-like words) that are not basic. In other words, forms that are derived, compounded, or periphrastic. Create enough forms to demonstrate the patterns you will have in your language to serve as examples. Once you have patterns established, it’s much easier to create more forms as you need them!
