 Today’s goal is to enter the new words you’ve created into your dictionary. As you write the definitions, try to capture the ways your speakers view time so you remember how the term is used in-world. Even if your world is quite different from Earth, you might consider including extra notes in the definition to draw connections with the Earth-based time word (or words) that most closely matches the way your speakers use that particular term. Whatever works best for you so you remember how you intended the word to be used!
