 Learn/Brainstorm/Try
</p>
<p>
 Think about your speakers and their world and how they would share information. Will they have written texts? If so, will the written texts be limited to a certain type of text? Or will all their “texts” be shared orally? I’m using “text” here as broadly as you can imagine: oral and/or written chunks of language that can convey information, entertain, persuade, or what have you.
</p>
<p>
 In your brainstorming, consider whether a writing system is appropriate for your speakers. If so, explore different writing systems to start thinking about what type of writing system might be best for your conlang. This might mean creating a unique writing system designed for your conlang or adapting an existing one for your language. For instance, if your speakers are situated on Earth and had extended contact with a community of speakers that use a particular writing system, then it might make sense for them to adapt that writing system for their own language.
</p>
<p>
 You will have another four days to consider whether you will have a writing system, so take your time with this decision and have fun exploring options!
