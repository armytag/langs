 Today’s goal is to write an introduction to how your language treats number for its nouns. Remember, if you don’t have number in your language, it’s good to have a section explicitly stating that. For instance, you might say the language does not distinguish number and then give a list of example noun phrases that are translated as both the singular and plural forms (e.g.
 <strong>
  <em>
   bilo
  </em>
 </strong>
 “river, rivers”).
</p>
<p>
 If you do mark number, describe how your system works and give examples of the inflections. I find it helpful to also explain, in prose, how the system works alongside the examples. It may feel like you’re explaining the same time three times over, but when you’re revisiting the grammar after a few months (or even a few years), you might find the over-explanation helpful!
</p>
<p>
 You may also find it helpful to have some of your sections presented together. If your inflections are more fusional, you may find it nearly impossible to talk about one inflection without talking about another. As you work on writing this portion of the grammar, use the organization and method that works best for your language!
