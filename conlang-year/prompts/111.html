 Now that you’ve expanded your dictionary entries for verbs, spend the day creating some new verbs and entering their information into the dictionary, being sure you follow the structure you’ve created for those entries. As you work, look back through your notes and make sure that every lexical source you created for to support verb inflections made it into the dictionary. Find a rhythm as you work—a rhythm that alternates between creating forms and documenting their information. The goal is to find a process that works for you so that you will get into a groove of documenting what you create.
