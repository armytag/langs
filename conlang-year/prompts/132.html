 Create/Make/List
</p>
<p>
 Using the structures you planned out yesterday, expand the list of NPs you created a couple days ago. Specifically, expand them to include multiple modifiers (e.g. multiple adjectives, demonstratives and adjectives), and, if relevant, inflect the head noun in a variety of forms (e.g. number, case). If your attributive modifiers agree with their head nouns in any way, make sure you remember to apply that agreement-marking to each modifier in the noun phrase.
</p>
<p>
 As you work, tweak any areas of the system that you find problems with or that you are not happy with. You may not always have multiple modifiers in a single noun phrase, but itâ€™s good to have a solid plan in place for when you do!
