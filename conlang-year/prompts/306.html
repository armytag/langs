 Learn/Brainstorm/Try
</p>
<p>
 Consider if you want to create features in your language that are specific to storytelling, such as a narrative tense that only occurs in the context of narrating a story. Genre-specific features like these can include grammatical features (e.g. inflections, clause structures), word choice, and discourse/text structures (e.g. ordering information in particular ways within a genre).
</p>
<p>
 You can use these features to reflect what your speakers hold as important for sharing stories and how they package information to communicate with each other.
</p>
<p>
 I encourage you to explore examples of stories across languages to get ideas for what you might consider. You may end up deciding you don’t want to do anything specific to storytelling, and that’s okay, too. Just have some fun exploring as you make the decision!
