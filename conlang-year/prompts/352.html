 For Lexember, you don’t necessarily need to create a new form. Expanding the use of an old word to incorporate new meanings and uses counts as creating words, too! For instance, perhaps you had a root that means “rock” and you decide to use that same form to mean “paperweight” or “doorstop”. Polysemy offers ways for you to expand the scope of your lexicon in naturalistic ways.
