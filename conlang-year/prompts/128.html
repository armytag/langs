<p>
 Now that you have brainstormed options, today’s goal is to make a plan for your adjectives—specifically, non-basic adjectives. Regardless of whether your language has adjectives that are basic roots, you can expand your adjective inventory by using nouns and verbs as sources.
</p>
<p>
 Also decide if nouns will agree in any way with the nouns they modify. They might agree in number, class, and/or function. This decision is linked to adjective sources. For instance, if your verbs agree with subjects, adjectives coming from verbs are more likely to carry the same kind of agreement markers.
</p>
<p>
 If you have decided to make a language that lacks adjectives, then use this time to make a plan for using nominal modifiers or predicative verbs.
