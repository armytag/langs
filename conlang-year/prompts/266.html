 Today’s goal focuses on a feature related to comparative strategies: strategies for forming a superlative, or a comparison of the extreme. For instance, if you are looking at a mouse, cat, and deer, you can say “The mouse is smallest (of all three)” or “The deer is tallest (of them all).” The superlative is a way of saying “of this group, NOUN is the most ATTRIBUTE,” where the attribute is any feature you might use as a point of comparison for the given group.
</p>
<p>
 Take some time today to explore superlative strategies in other languages to start thinking about how you might treat superlatives in your conlang.
