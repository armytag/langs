 Solidify/Write/Share

<p>
 Solidify the work you’ve done on adpositions by writing an introduction to a section on adpositions in your language’s documentation. I say “introduction” because there will likely be a time that you flesh out more features and will need to add to it. So it isn’t that what you’re writing today will be the complete section, but it should serve as a summary of your ideas for adpositions and how they work in your language.
</p>
<p>
 In your documentation, be sure to include any case-marking that accompanies your adpositions. As you do so, you may want to consider having case-marking differentiate possible meanings for a single adposition. For instance, German has a series of prepositions whose meanings slightly shift when the nouns occurring with them appear in the dative or accusative case. Accusative case-marking creates a meaning of movement while the dative case is interpreted as a static location. And so a phrase like
 <strong>
  <em>
   auf den Tisch
  </em>
 </strong>
 with the accusative means “onto the table” (i.e. something is moving from one location to a location on top of the table) while
 <strong>
  <em>
   auf dem Tisch
  </em>
 </strong>
 with the dative means “on the table” (i.e. something is situated on the table and hasn’t moved or isn’t moving locations).
