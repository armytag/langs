 As you’re creating Lexember words/entries, you may realize you want to change the order of words in your original planning list or switch out words entirely. And that’s okay! Change out your plans as needed to keep up the work and to stay invested in what you’re doing. Go with the inspiration you feel on a particular day rather than feeling like you have to stick to a list you made a couple weeks ago.
