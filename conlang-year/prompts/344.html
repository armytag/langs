 Another area of focus during this month is on documentation. As you create, check back in with your language documents to make sure they are up-to-date. Maybe you created a new kind of compound you want to mention in your noun section or a new derivation to include in the verb section. Or maybe you need to spend some time adding words to your dictionary as you work this month.
