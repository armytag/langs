 Now that you are finished with the translation, spend time today reviewing it and cleaning up any areas as necessary. Check to make sure the full text feels cohesive in your conlang—it can help to present your language’s translation as a full text without the English beside it so you’ve looking at and dealing exclusively with your language. It helps even more to then work from your language’s text and translate it back into English to make sure it says what you had intended it to say.
