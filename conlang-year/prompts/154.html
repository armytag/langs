 It’s okay if you only have a handful of forms at this point.

 Today’s focus is to create word forms for basic adverbs in your language. As a reminder, the adverbs that are most likely to belong to basic vocabulary are temporal and spatial (rather than manner). It’s okay if you only have a few adverbs at this point—tomorrow you will work on creating non-basic forms (e.g. compounds or derivations). If you chose not to have words that are categorized as adverbs, then create words that will support your plan for adverb-like meanings.
