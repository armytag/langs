 Update your dictionary to include the demonstrative forms you created—and be sure to enter any new lexical words you made to support the system.

 As a small piece of advice, I have found it incredibly helpful to keep a running list of all the forms that served as sources for grammatical units, whether they are the source of an inflectional affix or a grammatical particle. It’s easy to forget those pieces of information the more you work on a language, and there isn’t always a great place in the documentation to include the sources. If you keep a running list as a section within your language’s document, you can refer to it more easily in one area. It might surprise you how often that list may inspire you as you create more pieces of your language in the future.
