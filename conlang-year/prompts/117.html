<p>
 Now that you have brainstormed ideas for valency-increasing strategies (such as a causative form), use today to make concrete plans for what you will do in your language. While you can have more than one valency-increasing strategy, focus first on developing one before trying to make more. It helps to test out the features on a focused example before trying to expand the inventory to include more.
</p>
<p>
 As you map out your causative or other valency-increasing feature, make sure you identify any words you might need to create or use from your lexical inventory. You might need a new verb for a clausal construction, or you might need new lexical sources to grammaticalize a phrase or affix. Tomorrow you will set this plan in action!
