 Organize/Plan/Structure
</p>
<p>
 Organize your brainstorming notes about place names and make a list of the forms (words, affixes, etc.) you will need to make those place names come together. Your list may include forms you’ve already created and ones you still need to create. Include anything that will be helpful on your list so you have it all in one place.
</p>
<p>
 You may find it helpful to further organize your list, such as having a list of terrain features that can be used in names and a separate list of descriptors to combine with those terrain features. You may even create a separate list of words you want to reduce to derivational affixes to indicate place names. The lists don’t have to be exclusive—you may be able to use the same form as a descriptor and a terrain feature (e.g. following English modifier-noun word order, “hill” is a descriptor in “Hill Meadows” but a main terrain feature in “Rock Hill”).
