 Conlang Year is wrapping up, which means you have a working conlang and may be wondering where to go from here. Creating new words doesn’t need to end with Lexember or Conlang Year, so you can always return to this language and continue expanding its vocabulary. In fact, if you’ve already got all your Lexember words lined up for the rest of the month, you can keep going to make more words just for fun!
