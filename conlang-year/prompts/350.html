 Another step you might consider is turning your handwritten orthography into a font you can use on the computer. You can explore font-making software options that will allow you to do that. Some are quite expensive but offer great tools. Others are free but may have steep learning curves. Poke around online to see if there are any software programs that feel right for you. If youâ€™re not comfortable with vector design, then these programs may not be a good fit for you.
