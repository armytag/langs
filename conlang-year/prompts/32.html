<p>
 Yesterday I mentioned that you should select an order for your sound changes because, when sound changes apply to languages, they apply in a particular order. The ordering matters because changing the ordering of the rules can give you different results. For example, let’s say you have these three proto-forms in your language:
</p>
<p>
 And you have these four sound changes, in this order.
</p>
<p>
 Applying these four changes to the three forms above, you get the following results.
</p>
<p>
 The palatalization rule doesn’t apply to these examples because the high vowel in
 <em>
  *dinpa
 </em>
 lowers before the palatalization rule takes effect.
</p>
<p>
 Those are the results based on the particular ordering listed above. Without changing the proto-forms or the sound changes, watch what happens if you shift the ordering of the rules. For this demonstration, I’m going to reverse the order of the rules above, so they are now in this order:
</p>
<p>
 Applying these four changes to the three forms above, you get the following results.
</p>
<p>
 Notice that the results differ for two of the proto-forms when you compare the first set to the second one (the results for
 <em>
  *esge
 </em>
 remain the same) because the order of application has shifted. The palatalization rule now applies to
 <em>
  *dinpa
 </em>
 before the vowel lowers, and the glottal fricative [h] is deleted in
 <em>
  *lohzu
 </em>
 before consonants assimilate in voice, so the [z] keeps its voicing in
 <strong>
  <em>
   lozu
  </em>
 </strong>
 .
</p>
<p>
 These are just a few roots with a small set of sound changes. Imagine how different the forms might be with more data and more changes!
</p>
<p>
 And so, now that you have chosen sound changes and an order for them, run all your proto-forms through the changes in the order you selected. If you realize the forms aren’t quite working out the way you had hoped, you can try shifting the order of application to see if you like the results better, or you can tweak the rules as they are written to get a desired effect.
</p>
<p>
 I suggest you keep track of the changes as they apply in tables like I have here or in ordered notes so you can see how the forms are being affected at each stage. Further, I urge you to keep those notes so you can refer to them later so you can remember why you chose one ordering over another.
