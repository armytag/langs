 One (or both) of these forms may be the bare verb.

 Learn/Brainstorm/Try
</p>
<p>
 Consider whether you want to specifically mark the infinitive form of a verb (e.g.
 <em>
  to speak, hablar, sprechen
 </em>
 ) and, if so, how you want to mark it. As you consider that, also think about how you want to create an active participle (e.g.
 <em>
  speaking, hablando, sprechend(e)
 </em>
 ). (Ignore passive participles like
 <em>
  spoken
 </em>
 for now—those will come later!)
</p>
<p>
 These forms are grammatically diverse in many languages and can serve as modifiers and nominal elements in clause structures. So deciding how you want to form them will be a good first step for more complex clause forms later. I want you to start thinking about them now in conjunction with your verb inflections because, for example, if you decided to use the unmarked verb form as a particular aspect, you should decide if you want to also use the verb form in another grammatical role (you definitely can do that—it’s just something to consider as you create your verb system as a whole).
</p>
<p>
 Later this week you will actually create any forms you brainstorm right now. The goal here is to make sure you know what forms you want to mark and what lexical sources you might use to evolve any of those forms.
