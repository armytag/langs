<p>
 Formalize some of the decisions you’ve made about the basic foundation for your conlang’s grammatical structures by writing a basic grammar introduction in your language’s document. This will likely be short (unless you already have a lot to say!), but it will provide valuable information.
</p>
<p>
 For right now, your short introduction may read something like “My language has SVO word order with nominative-accusative alignment and is more analytic in its structures.” This may be a short sentence, but it provides valuable information about your language and how it will be structured.
</p>
<p>
 If you finish writing your introduction and want more to do today, create more nouns and verbs for your language. Starting tomorrow, you’ll be exploring options for nouns and ways they can be grammatically marked, so the more vocabulary you have to experiment with, the more you can solidify your system and see it in action. Take a look through your nouns and make sure you have a variety of phonological forms with semantic diversity. If you see any gaps, create some new nouns to start filling them in!
