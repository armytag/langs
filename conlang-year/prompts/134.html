 Now that you have introduced your modifiers in a section on adjectives, expand the information to include their uses in noun phrases. Describe where adjectives typically occur relative to the head noun they’re modifying and also the typical word order when multiple modifiers occur in the same noun phrase. Use the example NPs you created on Days 130 and 132 in your discussion (or feel free to create new ones!).
</p>
<p>
 If your adjectives inflect to agree in any way with the head noun they’re modifying (e.g. class, number, case), provide examples to demonstrate those inflections. Even if they don’t, it’s good to mention that in your documentation. You can, for instance, provide a pair of NPs, each headed by a noun belonging to a different noun class, being modified by the same adjective (showing that it doesn’t shift shapes even as the head noun shifts).
