 Today’s goal is to go over the translated text you worked on (whether it was a long or short text) to look for any areas that need touching up or reconsidering. Or you may even find a small portion you forgot to translate! You will have a couple more days with time for fixing any problem areas, so you don’t need to address them all today. The longer a text is that you translate, the more issues you might come across as you review your work. (Translation is difficult work!)
</p>
<p>
 If you have an orthography, start thinking about how you will spell the forms in your short text, being sure to fully consider whether you had intended the spelling to be historical, modern, or somewhere in between. If it is a historical spelling system, you may need to pull out proto-forms of your words so you know how they should look in your orthography.
