 As I give hints for keeping up with regular participation in Lexember, also know that it’s okay if you need to skip a day. Or two. Or a week. It’s okay if you start Lexember and then realize you just don’t have the time, energy, resources, or whatever to continue posting on a daily basis.

 If you’re not able to post, I encourage you to try to find time to create. Maybe all you’ve got in you on a particular day is to jot down a string of sounds that you particularly like and want to incorporate into your language as a root. Maybe you saw a derivation that you think would fit well into your language. Something as small as jotting down an idea for Future You to consider is still doing the work and being involved in conlanging.
