 Today’s goal is to document all the decisions you’ve made about adverb clauses. Incorporate the examples you’ve created, explaining them and their features as you work. If you had already started a section on dependent clause structures in general, you may want to include this information as a subsection there. However, you may also choose to start an entirely new section for these non-embedded clause structures. Wherever you choose to put it, remember to use your examples and write about any special features you want to remember moving forward!
