 Organize/Plan/Structure
</p>
<p>
 Take some time to select which phrasal coordination strategy (or strategies) you are going to incorporate into your language. For now, only focus on phrasal coordination (e.g. linking noun phrases like “Jo and my neighbor,” verb phrases like “ate breakfast and took a nap,” or adposition phrases like “to the store and around the corner”). Clausal coordination may differ and will be a focus later.
</p>
<p>
 Once you’ve settled on that, plan out what you’ll need to create to put that strategy into place, whether you need to create new lexical forms to grammaticalize coordinating conjunctions and/or draw up structural templates to organize your thoughts.
