 Today’s goal is to really focus on any chart you’ve made. That includes any inflectional chart or derivational chart, making sure they include all the necessary forms and reflect newer work you’ve done. But it also includes the oldest charts you made, such as phonetic charts. Make sure you’re actually using all the sounds you included in your language—that they have all made it into proto-forms!
