 Incorporate the translation you completed into your language document to showcase your language features in action. You can simply include it at the end of the document as an appendix of sorts, or you could choose to do a write-up about it. In such a write-up, you could introduce your text, contextualizing and situating it in your conworld. If you created an orthography, you could also insert an image of the text handwritten to show the full written form.
