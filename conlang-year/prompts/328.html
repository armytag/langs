 Today’s goal is to update your dictionary. You’ve done a lot of work over the past couple of weeks, and you likely created new forms, some of which may not have made it into the dictionary. Go through your notes and your work to see if you find any words that you need to create entries for.
</p>
<p>
 If you created an orthography, you can also take a moment to consider whether you should add spelling information to the dictionary entries. In most cases, it won’t be possible to add the full written form unless you create a font for your language. However, you can still make notes in entries, especially for any forms that may not be predictable.
