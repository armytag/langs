   Tip:

 It’s totally fine if your language has a comparative form but lacks a superlative. Just show what your language does instead!

<p>
 Document your decisions on superlatives in your language by expanding the section you wrote on comparative forms/structures. Incorporate examples of how your language works as you describe this feature in your conlang.
</p>
<p>
 Your language may have dedicated comparative forms but lack a dedicated superlative form/structure, and that’s totally okay! Just document what your language does instead to demonstrate how your conlang would translate instances like “I saw the smallest mouse” or “This flower is prettiest.”
