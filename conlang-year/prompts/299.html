<p>
 First, take a moment to divide the text into four sections—you will tackle one section a day to complete the translation. The sections don’t need to be of equal length. It can help to make the first section the longest to give yourself a running start, and it can also help to make sections shorter that you know will be grammatically tricky.
</p>
<p>
 Once you’ve divided the text, translate the first section, putting all the foundational work you’ve done together and smoothing out the translation as you go. If you had already added in inflections and grammatical details along the way, you may realistically have already translated the text. In that case, use today to comb through the first section in finer detail, double-checking any work you’ve done. It can help to talk through the features out loud to make sure you’ve got everything included.
