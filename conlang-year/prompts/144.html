<p>
 Today’s goal is to create examples that incorporate your cardinal numbers in context to showcase their features and use, both when they occur alongside nouns (e.g. “Three squirrels run up the tree”) and as pronoun forms, if your language allows that (e.g. “Three run up the tree”). As you create contexts for your numbers, be sure to put them in a variety of clausal contexts to demonstrate how (if at all) they interact with other features, such as case, class, or number.
</p>
<p>
 For instance, in “Three squirrels run up the tree,” the cardinal number occurs with an animate noun in subject position. So other sentences to accompany that example might be “I grabbed eight sticks” (inanimate object), “Nan’s two sisters walked” (with possessive), “The two sisters’ friends walked” (in possessive), and “I gave the four fluffy dogs biscuits” (animate indirect object with a modifier).
</p>
<p>
 Work on putting numbers in a variety of contexts to make sure you’ve thought about ways they interact with these kinds of variables.
