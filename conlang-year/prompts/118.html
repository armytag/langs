 Whether you decided to create a morphological causative (e.g. a derivational affix) or a purely syntactic one (e.g. a particular construction provides a causative interpretation), use today to put your plans into action. Create any forms or templates you need and then provide several example sentences to identify and work out any problem areas. For instance, you may need to reconsider forms if the affix creates phonologically awkward segments or you may realize that your original plan for the causative did not take ditransitive verbs into consideration.

<p>
 If you donâ€™t run into any problems, celebrate with creating a few more examples to showcase your work!
