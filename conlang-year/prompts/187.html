 You may need to update verb head entries in your dictionary to reflect the imperative.

 Organize/Plan/Structure
</p>
<p>
 Review your verb inflection charts and add new entries for the imperative forms and their inflections (remember that even if they are the bare/unmarked form of the verb, that in and of itself is an inflectional form to note).
</p>
<p>
 Also review verb entries in your dictionary to see if it makes sense to add the imperative as a form in the head words for verbs (i.e. the forms explicitly listed for each verb entry in the dictionary). If the inflectional forms should be included in the entries (e.g. they are not fully predictable and need to be noted), update each verb entry.
