<p>
 Today shifts the focus to word-formation strategies, specifically focusing on compounding and derivation (though others are possible, these are two that show up in most frequently and tend to be more productive).
</p>
<p>
 Compounding involves combining two or more words to create a new word. Compounds can be split into two major types: endocentric and exocentric. Endocentric compounds have a head word that points to the overall meaning of the compound, like
 <em>
  house
 </em>
 in
 <em>
  doghouse
 </em>
 . Where the head word occurs in an endocentric compound often follows the headedness of the language in general. Exocentric compounds are more metaphorical or idiomatic, like
 <em>
  forget-me-not
 </em>
 referring to a flower or
 <em>
  ne’er-do-well
 </em>
 referring to a person. Their meanings need to be learned, even by native speakers.
</p>
<p>
 Derivation involves affixation, where an affix changes the meaning of the root its added to, such as
 <em>
  un-
 </em>
 being added to the verb
 <em>
  tie
 </em>
 to create the verb
 <em>
  untie
 </em>
 . Some derivational affixes can also change the root’s lexical category, such as
 <em>
  -ness
 </em>
 changing the adjective
 <em>
  happy
 </em>
 to the noun
 <em>
  happiness
 </em>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Use today to find ways languages use compounds and derivations to get inspired for what you might do in your own language. As you explore, also consider how compounds and/or derivations may interact with your sound changes (e.g. are compounds formed before, during, or after the sound changes are applied?). Modern forms can be quite different depending on whether compounds/derivations are formed before or after key sound changes.
</p>
<p>
 As a side note, your causative may have been one of your first derivations, so you may have already begun a pattern of derivation for your language! (It depends on whether your language treats the causative as a clausal construction, inflection, or derivation.)
