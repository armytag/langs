 While your work set you up for a smoother translation process, you may still need to make adjustments.

   Tip:

 I recommend writing/drawing these glyph forms for now so you have them.

 If you are working on orthography, this is the first of four days set aside for you to focus on evolving the original images you created for your glyphs. Focus on taking the distinctive elements of the images (e.g. what lines/shapes are more prominent and make one image different from others, what lines/shapes are retained as you try drawing the image more quickly) and turning them into the shapes that will become your conlang’s orthographical forms.
</p>
<p>
 As you work, I recommend doing it all with pen and paper (or stylus and screen) so you get your ideas down. If you are a digital artist, then, by all means, use whatever programs you have at your disposal to make these forms. The important thing is to get these shapes—turning them into something like a computer-based font is outside the scope of this week’s goals. (At least for most of us mere mortals!)
</p>
<p>
 If you are working on translation, this is the first of five days (yes, you have five days!) for creating a smooth translation of your original text in your conlang. So divvy up the work in a way that feels good for you and begin tackling it today. While you have done a lot of prep work to make this process smoother, you may still need to make adjustments as you go. You may find that a particular word wasn’t the right choice or that you hadn’t really considered a particular verb inflection and how it might be used in a clause.
