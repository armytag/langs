 If you created an orthography, you’ve now had a chance to apply your orthography to a variety of forms. Today, take a moment to reassess your system and make sure it’s working how you had hoped. You may find areas where you need to reconsider how to spell forms, especially forms that are reduced as affixes or particles, such as inflections or derivations.
</p>
<p>
 If you’re focusing on translation, consider any additional needs you may have for translation in general. Perhaps you’re happy with this particular text, but start thinking about more forms you may need to tackle for more complex translations. Or, if you’re not sure how else you could expand your system, then have some fun creating new words for the day.
