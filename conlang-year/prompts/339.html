 My favorite part of Lexember is seeing what other people have come up with. If you havenâ€™t already, take a moment to look around online to find other participants. You may be inspired by what you see, whether you like a particular format/design, type of information included, or language feature. Part of the conlanging journey is to continue exploring languages at large, including other conlangs!
