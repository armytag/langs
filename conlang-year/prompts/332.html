 Lexember is a month-long conlanging celebration, when conlangers share a word in their language every day on social media. Lexember was started in 2012 by Mia DeSanzo and Pete Bleackley, and it is still going strong. Conlang Year will end with Lexember, challenging you to create (and hopefully share!) a new word every day in December.
</p>
<p>
 While it isn’t necessary to have a theme for the words you share for Lexember, I find a theme helpful for collecting my thoughts and focusing my work. And so, today’s prompt is to brainstorm ideas for a potential Lexember theme (or set of themes). For instance, your theme might be “cooking,” and you could generate vocabulary related to cooking, whether you focus on ingredients, implements, food, or all of the above.
</p>
<p>
 Think about what will keep you most interested and moving forward during the final push of this Conlang Year challenge!
