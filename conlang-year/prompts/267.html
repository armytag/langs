 You may also consider instances where the superlative is treated like a nominal: “The mouse is the smallest.”

 Organize/Plan/Structure
</p>
<p>
 Now that you’ve explored options for superlatives, focus today on outlining a strategy for your language to handle superlative situations in the predicate, such as how your language might translate a structure like “The fox is happiest.”
</p>
<p>
 If you have a dedicated superlative inflection or periphrastic structure, you may also consider whether your language allows them to function as nominals, as in “The fox is the happiest.”
</p>
<p>
 As with comparatives, you may be deciding on how to translate such instances without having an actual dedicated superlative form or phrase.
