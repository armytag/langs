 Today’s goal is to create more indefinite pronoun (and modifier) forms that indicate more one of a given entity, such as
 <em>
  some, few, many,
 </em>
 and
 <em>
  all
 </em>
 . As you create forms, it’s also good to consider how your language might work with these forms as modifiers, especially considering how
 <em>
  all
 </em>
 might treat the noun it occurs with differently than than
 <em>
  some
 </em>
 or
 <em>
  many
 </em>
 . It may require a different number inflection (or even case inflection) for the noun it occurs with, especially if you have inflections like a paucal or a collective in your language.
</p>
<p>
 There are a lot of these forms you could create, so you don’t need to try to get it all done in a day. Rather, focus on getting a solid start so that later, if you want to add more, you already have a system in place to create and structure the forms.
