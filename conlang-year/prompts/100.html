<p>
 Give examples to show your plan for the infinitive and active participle verb forms in your language. These may end up being the same form (e.g. a verb form like
 <strong>
  <em>
   kobu
  </em>
 </strong>
 could be used to mean “to jump” or “jumping”), but you also may have chosen different strategies for marking these forms, whether they occur with particular affixes or particles (such as an infinitive marker).
</p>
<p>
 If you already know how you want to use the forms in basic clauses, you can give examples of these forms in action, translating clauses like “The rabbit saw the jumping frog” or “The rabbit left the room to jump.”
</p>
<p>
 It’s also okay if you’re not quite sure how you want to incorporate these forms into clause structures just yet. If that’s the case, just write out lists of example verbs to focus on how different verbs look in the infinitive and active participles.
