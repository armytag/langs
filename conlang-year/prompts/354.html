 If you haven’t already, find a conlang community to join. It will most likely be online (but lucky you if there is a local community that holds in-person meetings or events!). It is often more satisfying and enjoyable to continue your conlang journey when you have a community to participate in. There are communities of all types and sizes available, which is quite exciting—it means you have the opportunity to explore and find a group that feels best for you!
