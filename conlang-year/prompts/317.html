 </strong>
 As glyphs are used, they naturally evolve. You will just speed up that process!

 Organize/Plan/Structure

<p>
 If you are working on orthography, use today to make a plan for how you will evolve the shapes of your glyphs to represent more modern forms. The original images you created represent an ancient point of your writing system. Think about how those shapes would shift with years (or decades or even centuries!) of writers reproducing those images in different environments and under time constraints and with newer implements and more varieties of writing surfaces… You’re going to speed up that evolutionary process this week!
</p>
<p>
 If you are translating, reassess your translation needs in light of your exploratory brainstorming yesterday. The next five days will be used for translation, so prepare your notes and organizational system and whatever else you need today to get ready for that translation.
