 Today’s goal is to lay out a plan for dealing with situations that might involve a headless relative clause (or similar structure). You may decide that your language will not have a structure, in which case plan out how your language would translate instances where another language uses one. As you work on a plan, remember to keep your focus on
 <em>
  your
 </em>
 language and its features. You don’t need to create structures simply because another language has them. Make sure what you’re creating fits in with your overall vision for your conlang.
