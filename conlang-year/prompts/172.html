<p>
 Today’s goal is to create the forms you need to actually make your first few personal names. Depending on your strategy, you may need to create more lexical words (e.g. more modifiers or common nouns) and/or derivations to support your vision. You don’t need to create every form you’ll ever need for creating personal names today—focus on creating (or pulling together a list of) enough forms to get you through a handful of names to get started. Your work today will support your task tomorrow (which is actually creating some names!).
