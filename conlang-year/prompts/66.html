<p>
 The strategies you came up with for possession may require creating new grammatical markers. If so, use today to think through what lexical sources you want to use as origins for those grammatical markers. You’ll have tomorrow to actually create and test the forms—today’s focus is on figuring out what the lexical sources will actually be. Depending on your strategies, these new markers may be affixes, clitics, or adpositions.
</p>
<p>
 On the other hand, you may not need to create anything new. In that case, you can use today to create new words—and you may even want to put together more examples of how possessive constructions work to showcase your ideas.
