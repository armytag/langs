 If you needed to create new markers for possessive constructions, you were tasked with selecting the lexical sources for those markers yesterday. Today’s goal is to actually create the original lexical forms and then reduce them to their grammaticalized forms for use in possessive constructions. After you create the form(s), provide examples to showcase them in use.
</p>
<p>
 You may not have needed any new grammatical markers but may have instead decided to use word order or particular adpositions for possessive forms. If that’s the case, be sure to write out how you plan on representing the meanings and then provide examples.
</p>
<p>
 I find it helpful to describe examples as I create them to remember later on what meaning distinctions are being made. For instance, if you had wanted to distinguish different types of meaning within possessive constructions, it wouldn’t be helpful to only provide a translation like “Kala’s book.” Providing additional content beyond the translation can remind you later on what the particular meaning is that you wanted for that phrase, such as writing “Kala’s book (the one that she wrote)” as the translation.
