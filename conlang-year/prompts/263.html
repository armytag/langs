 Your strategy may require other types of modifiers in the noun phrase, like an adposition phrase.

<p>
 Some languages allow comparative forms to be embedded as modifiers inside a noun phrase. For instance, we can say “the faster turtle,” “a taller giraffe,” or “the more powerful wizard”  in English. Today’s goal is for you to decide if your language will allow the same kind of embedding. Depending on how your comparative forms work (if you have them at all!), it may make more sense for these embedded structures to look more like reduced relative clauses or appositional phrases, such as “the turtle, the faster one” or “the wizard more powerful than others.”

 If this isn’t much of a decision point for you to make, then you can instead have some fun creating more vocabulary!
