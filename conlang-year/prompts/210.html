 Create/Make/List
</p>
<p>
 Over the past couple days, you identified and listed what forms you need to actually create your relative clauses (e.g. relative pronoun, relativizing subordinating conjunction). Use today to take the time to create those forms. If you find that youâ€™ve already got what you need, then great! Use the time to create more words in general, which will come in handy as you continue making more clauses. Having new words to pull from is always a good thing in conlanging!
