<p>
 Today’s focus is creating a variety of compound words in your language. Aim to create a variety of forms, demonstrating what your language allows, such as noun-noun (“mailbox”), verb-verb (“sleepwalk”), verb-noun (“jumprope”), or noun-verb (“sunbathe”) combinations.
</p>
<p>
 If your language is highly analytic, your compound forms may not merge into a single word form, which means there may not be as much phonological interaction at the boundaries. Your language may have multiple kinds of compounds. For instance, older compounds may join and undergo phonological shifts as a single unit while newer ones may remain more distinct units.
