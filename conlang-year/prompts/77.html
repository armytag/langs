<p>
 Build on the work you did yesterday to create second-person pronoun forms. Everything from yesterday’s prompt applies to today (e.g. remember to create all the inflected forms you need for your language’s system).
</p>
<p>
 One thing to remember in the pronoun system is that possessive pronoun forms may differ from possessive modifier forms that are based on pronouns. For instance, in English, the possessive pronouns are
 <em>
  mine, ours, yours, his, hers, its,
 </em>
 and
 <em>
  theirs
 </em>
 while the possessive modifiers are
 <em>
  my, our, your, his, her, its,
 </em>
 and
 <em>
  their
 </em>
 . For the most part, the possessive pronoun forms occur with an
 <em>
  -s
 </em>
 after the possessive modifier form. Your language doesn’t have to treat those forms differently, but it can. If it does, just keep that in mind as you create forms.
</p>
<p>
 For the second-person forms specifically, another note is to remember to include number information when defining the pronouns in English. The English second-person pronoun
 <em>
  you
 </em>
 is the same form for singular and plural—it lacks number distinction. That means saying a particular forms in your language means “you” will not be enough unless your language lacks number-marking. Be sure to define your forms as something like “you (sg.)” or “you (pl.)” if you have a singular/plural number distinction.
