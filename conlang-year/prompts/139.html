<p>
 Today’s goal shifts the focus to numbers in your conlang. Spend today exploring options for number bases. Some options you might consider include base-5, base-10, base-12, and base-20. (Though there are theoretically an endless number of possibilities!) The base you choose will affect how many forms you will need to create for the numbers.
</p>
<p>
 You can also explore options for a less specific counting system. Rather than having forms that mean precise amounts like “one, three, eight,” you could instead have a variety of quantifying forms that mean “couple, few, handful, many” that provide estimated amounts.
</p>
<p>
 Have some fun exploring options as you decide what strategy you’re interested in pursuing!
