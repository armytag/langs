# MyConlang

### By armytag

## Goal:

Make a language for an ancient but technologically-sophisticated fictional society (e.g. Tales of Earthsea)

## Intended Audience and Media:

Myself, and readers of possible stories involving the language.  MyConlang will be shared via written content, including poetry and stories.

## Conworld

Speakers are human on an Earth-like world. They live in a river valley among some mountains, not far from the sea.
