# MyConlang

By armytag

**Goal:** I want to create a language that feels enjoyable for me to use, and would be proudly sharing with others even when untranslated.  I also want to explore a logographic (heiroglyphic) writing system, and dense morphology.

### Ideas
- Complex syllables at some point in the evolution
- Codified for use in astronomy and other early sciences
    - This should be reflected in the earliest written form, but not the earliest spoken form.

## Intended Audience and Media:

My documentation will take the form of markdown files that can be turned into HTML or PDF for distribution.  I may suppliment this with some written work in a notebook, but I should digitize any physical notes on a regular basis.

I hope to share progress in the conlang through simple social media posts.  These should involve some cute examples of some part of the language, and have minimal written description.
