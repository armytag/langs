# MyConlang

By armytag

**Goal:** I want to create a language that feels enjoyable for me to use, and would be proudly sharing with others even when untranslated.  I also want to explore a logographic (heiroglyphic) writing system, and dense morphology.

### Ideas
- Complex syllables at some point in the evolution
- Codified for use in astronomy and other early sciences
    - This should be reflected in the earliest written form, but not the earliest spoken form.

## Intended Audience and Media:

My documentation will take the form of markdown files that can be turned into HTML or PDF for distribution.  I may suppliment this with some written work in a notebook, but I should digitize any physical notes on a regular basis.

I hope to share progress in the conlang through simple social media posts.  These should involve some cute examples of some part of the language, and have minimal written description.

## Speakers and Conworld

My language will be spoken (originally) by a group of humans living along a major mountain range that parallels the coastline.  There is some magic in this setting, although this doesn't affect the people physiologically.  The first script is developed by astronomers working/living in caves up in the mountains.

The speakers have typical human physiology, meaning they have two arms and hands, two legs and feet, a torso, and a head.  They have two eyes, two ears, one mouth, and one nose.  They have dense hair on their heads, armpits, and crotch, with smaller hairs on their arms and legs.  Men also have hair on their face and chest, which is thicker and bushier than the average human man.  The speakers have skin on the darker side.  They move around their environment by walking, running, climbing, and occasionally swimming.

The original speakers of the language lived in a valley in the foothills of a major mountain range.  A river runs through the valley, large enough to support some urbanization but still close enough to the mountain source that it isn't overly wide yet.  It's mostly a tropical dry forest biome with seasonal rains causing a long dry and long wet period, which has a major effect on the kinds of flora and fauna in the region.
