## Prompt

### Process

* Choose a clade (taxon) of organisms. This clade shouldn’t be so broad it's at the level of a kingdom or phylum, but it also shouldn’t be so narrow as a subspecies. Something around within the family-genus range should do nicely, though you could wiggle away from that range as needed.

* Choose 2-6 locations representative of this clade. For a fossil clade, this could be the locations of major palaeontological finds; for a modern clade this could include regions where the clade likely first evolved or originated, or where it has the highest degree of biodiversity. Alternatively, you could just pick your favourite (sub)species and the regions where they’re found. These regions should ideally be fairly confined locations: if a species has, for example, a circumpolar distribution, then choose a subspecies that’s limited to the Canadian Archipelago, or Fennoscandia, or Kamchatka, etc.

* Choose 3-6 languages based on these locations. For each region, find some literature on a language indigenous to that area. If there are a few languages indigenous to the region, you can pick all of them or whichever seems like it’ll be easiest to work with. If you can’t find good material for languages indigenous to the region, you can look at closely related languages, just don’t go too far away.

    * Make sure at least 2 languages are from different language macrofamilies. The majority of your languages can be from the same family, but there should be at least one wildcard. For example, if your clade is fairly well confined to south-east Asia, you might have mostly Austroasiatic languages, but you should also include at least one Sino-Tibetan or Austronesian language from the region that makes sense.

* Create a conlang based on these languages. Every phonological and grammatical decision you make should be clearly motivated or inspired by something present in the natural languages selected above. You are also free to make extrapolations therefrom: as you develop, it may make sense to make a decision based on what you’ve already drafted for the conlang so far, even if it’s not directly rooted in any of the natural languages. This is encouraged and the thesis of my Segments article. For instance, applying a morphophonological process from one language to a phonemic series of another language could create a phone that is not present in either, or you might co-opt a morphosyntactic structure from one language to help mark something pragmatic from another language, etc.

* Include at least one phoneme inspired by your clade. This phone could be anything, both human-capable or not, so long as its inclusion is because of the clade: pantherans might have a sub-laryngeal roar, pelecaniforms might have a rostral percussive, alpheids might have manual cavitations, and salicoids might have something psithuristic. This segment need not even be a phone and could be visual, pheromonal, or something else, so long as it contributes to word meaning.

### Tasks

* Document and showcase your language, making sure to illustrate how you met each step or restriction along the way.

* Translate and gloss at least five (5) example sentences from acceptable sources: syntax tests from Zephyrus (z!stest &c) or sentences from Mareck’s 5 Minutes of Your Day activity (make sure to note which ones).

* Showcase at least 12 lexical items and at least 2 conceptual metaphors directly inspired by your clade in some way. For example: if the clade is flight-capable, then they might have some specific flight vocabulary; if they have shells, then they might have some specific shell-sense vocabulary or simple roots for each shell segment; plants might have a very different concept of death than we do; pelagic sharks might consider swimming and breathing to be synonymous.

* For extra brownie points, include a Star Wars easter egg for May the 4th (that's today!), or include a Star Trek easter egg in conscientious objection.

* For even more brownie points, exalt a queen for Victoria Day (that's the due date!), or include an anti-imperialist message in conscientious objection.

* Discuss some of the things you learned along the way. This could be an overview of your favourite things gleaned from your source languages, or it could be a list of all the things you found really interesting that didn’t make it into the final conlang, or even just the biological rabbit-hole you went down because of this prompt.

## Newar

### Nouns
- Basic form: root + derivative-suffix + inflectional-suffix
    - Derivation from verbal, adjectival, adverbial, and nominal bases.  Most derivation is verbal.
    - Inflection for number and case
        - Unmarked singular and marked plural
        - Many cases suffixes also involve a preceing oblique suffix
        - Cases suffixes for nominative (unmarked), agentive, instrumental, ablative, dative, locative, genitive
- Nominal bases can combine to form compounds
    - Nominal compounds are either subordinate, coordinate, or idiomatic
        - Subordinate compounds are determinative ('one who...'), comparative ('which are like...'), appositional ('green + bird = parrot'), numeral ('two + hundred')
        - Coordinate compounds are collective ('wife and husband = spouse') or contrastive ('water and fire = enmity') *(this seems similar to Mandarin)*
        - Idiomatic compounds have a different meaning from the components ('gold + bird = person from whom one can make a profit')
- Pronouns are personal, demonstrative/interrogative, and other
    - Personal pronouns distinguish between first, second, and third persons
        - Personal plural pronouns are formed by adding plural suffix
        - Personal first person pronouns have clusivity distinction
        - Second and third person pronouns have honorific and non-honorific forms
    - Demonstrative pronouns are third person pronouns with remote and proximate distinctions
    - Interrogative pronouns for humans, non-human beings, and non-beings
    - Interrogative pronouns form the base for conjuctive constructions ('John, who...') and indefinite pronouns
    - Demonstrative and interrogative pronouns form distributive plurals through reduplication of the base
- Monomorphemic numerals for 'one' to 'ten' and 'hundred', 'thousand', 'lakh', and 'crore'.  Other numbers are compounds.
    - Some basic numerals occur after nouns to create a specific meaning like measures of distance
    - Teens are formed by 'ten' + /-n-/ + basic numeral
    - Multiples of 10 are formed by basic numeral + reduced form of 'ten'
    - Multiples of 100 or 1,000 are formed by basic numeral + 'hundred'/'thousand'
    - Final basic digit is added where relevant (e.g. 'three-ten four' for 34)
    - Further structures for fractions are listed

### Verbs
- Basic form: root + (causitive) + inflectional-suffix
    - Verbs derive through auxiliary words, not morphological suffixes
    - Verbs do not inflect for person
    - Verbal roots are monosyllabic
- Verbal derivation can be transitivization or causativization
    - Transitivization occurs through voicing changes
    - Causativization occurs through causitive suffix /-k/ and sometimes additionally another preceding suffix
- Verbal inflections
    - Conjunct denotes first-person subject (occurs for past, non-past, and imperative)
    - Disjunct denotes second-person or third-person subjects (occurs for past, non-past, and imperative)
    - Past forms include a proximate/remote suffix (e.g. verbal-base + past-disjunct-suffix + proximate/remote-suffix)
    - Infinitive denotes a verbal noun
    - Past participle takes an auxiliary verb and denotes an incomplete action
    - Habitual denotes habitual actions
- Compound verbs are idiomatic or auxiliary
    - Idiomatic verbs occur as noun followed by a main verb, and has meaning different from components (e.g. 'head + prop(infinitive) = work hard')
    - Auxiliary verbs can denote permissive, causitive, perfective aspect, continuation, beginning of work, or work in advance
        - When joined with an auxiliary verb, the main verb will be in infinitive, past-participle, or habitual form (with different results)

### Adjectives
- Demonstrative and interrogative roots are basically adjectival in function
- Comparatives and superlatives are by adding specific words before the adjective
- Adjectives can be derived from verbs, nouns, or from other adjectives
- Demonstrative bases for proximate-to-addresser, proximate-to-addressee, remote, and extremely-remote
    - Demonstratives can combine with other adjectives to convey a certain amount/degree of that adjective
- Interrogative bases for humans, animate-non-humans and inanimates (including abstract nouns), and locations

### Adverbs
- Simple adverbs are monomorphemic
- Adverbs can be derived from verbal, adjectival, onomatopoeic, and phonesthetic bases
    - Onomatopoeic and phonesthetic bases are used to convey momentary or continuing aspects
    - Base reduplication can convey repeated actions

### Particles and Postpositions
- Particles can convey emphatic, conjunctive, quotative, expletive, negative, prohibitive, benedictive, determinative, exclamatory, hortative, initiative, responsive, vocative, questions, interrogative, honorific, intensifier, nullifier, and sentence nullifier
    - Conjunctive particles are either coordinative or subordinative
        - Coordinative particles can be cumulative ('and'), alternative ('or'), adversative ('even though'), or illative ('therefore')
- Postpositions come after nouns, pronouns, adjectives, certain adverbs, and non-finite verbs to indicate place, direction, source, method, etc.

### Classifiers
- Verbal classifiers convey aspectual distinctions ('once', 'suddenly')
- Nominatal classifiers denote qualities of the noun, and are used when quantifying the noun

### Reduplication
- Interrogative, demonstrative, reflexive, and indefinite nominal/pronominal bases can be reduplicated to convey distributive plural
- Numerals with classifiers can be reduplicated to indicate distributions ('one by one')
- Classifiers without numerals can be reduplicated to indicate emphasized innumerable distribution ('many of X' or 'many times')
- Verbs in past and non-past forms can be reduplicated to bring emphasis
- Verbs in past-participle form can be reduplicated to imply repeated continuous action
- Verbs in imperative and habitual forms can be reduplicated to indicate more intensive action
- Verbs reduplicated with emphatic particle between reduplication indicates intensified repetition of the action
- Verbs in non-finite form can be reduplicated to give sense of continuity of past-participle incompletive form
- Adjectives can be reduplicated to *reduce* intensity ('sour' to 'sourish')
- Adverbs can be reduplicated to indicate repeated action
    - Final syllable can be triplicated to indicate continuous fast action
- Postpositions can be reduplicated to *increase* degree
- Nouns can be reduplicated with slight sound change (echo) to generalize the meaning ('house' to 'houses etc.')

## Sinhala

### Typology
- Highly consistent OV language, with modifiers preceding heads
- Predicates can be verbal or non-verbal
    - Non-verbal predicates do not need a copula
- Clause types classified by verb classes and by number of valency relations
    - Combined with this is an active-inactive dichotomy
- Adjectives do not inflect for degree but take adverbs instead
- More standard identifiers precede variable elements (e.g. family name before given name before title)
