## Prompt

### Process

* Choose a clade (taxon) of organisms. This clade shouldn’t be so broad it's at the level of a kingdom or phylum, but it also shouldn’t be so narrow as a subspecies. Something around within the family-genus range should do nicely, though you could wiggle away from that range as needed.

* Choose 2-6 locations representative of this clade. For a fossil clade, this could be the locations of major palaeontological finds; for a modern clade this could include regions where the clade likely first evolved or originated, or where it has the highest degree of biodiversity. Alternatively, you could just pick your favourite (sub)species and the regions where they’re found. These regions should ideally be fairly confined locations: if a species has, for example, a circumpolar distribution, then choose a subspecies that’s limited to the Canadian Archipelago, or Fennoscandia, or Kamchatka, etc.

* Choose 3-6 languages based on these locations. For each region, find some literature on a language indigenous to that area. If there are a few languages indigenous to the region, you can pick all of them or whichever seems like it’ll be easiest to work with. If you can’t find good material for languages indigenous to the region, you can look at closely related languages, just don’t go too far away.

    * Make sure at least 2 languages are from different language macrofamilies. The majority of your languages can be from the same family, but there should be at least one wildcard. For example, if your clade is fairly well confined to south-east Asia, you might have mostly Austroasiatic languages, but you should also include at least one Sino-Tibetan or Austronesian language from the region that makes sense.

* Create a conlang based on these languages. Every phonological and grammatical decision you make should be clearly motivated or inspired by something present in the natural languages selected above. You are also free to make extrapolations therefrom: as you develop, it may make sense to make a decision based on what you’ve already drafted for the conlang so far, even if it’s not directly rooted in any of the natural languages. This is encouraged and the thesis of my Segments article. For instance, applying a morphophonological process from one language to a phonemic series of another language could create a phone that is not present in either, or you might co-opt a morphosyntactic structure from one language to help mark something pragmatic from another language, etc.

* Include at least one phoneme inspired by your clade. This phone could be anything, both human-capable or not, so long as its inclusion is because of the clade: pantherans might have a sub-laryngeal roar, pelecaniforms might have a rostral percussive, alpheids might have manual cavitations, and salicoids might have something psithuristic. This segment need not even be a phone and could be visual, pheromonal, or something else, so long as it contributes to word meaning.

### Tasks

* Document and showcase your language, making sure to illustrate how you met each step or restriction along the way.

* Translate and gloss at least five (5) example sentences from acceptable sources: syntax tests from Zephyrus (z!stest &c) or sentences from Mareck’s 5 Minutes of Your Day activity (make sure to note which ones).

* Showcase at least 12 lexical items and at least 2 conceptual metaphors directly inspired by your clade in some way. For example: if the clade is flight-capable, then they might have some specific flight vocabulary; if they have shells, then they might have some specific shell-sense vocabulary or simple roots for each shell segment; plants might have a very different concept of death than we do; pelagic sharks might consider swimming and breathing to be synonymous.

* For extra brownie points, include a Star Wars easter egg for May the 4th (that's today!), or include a Star Trek easter egg in conscientious objection.

* For even more brownie points, exalt a queen for Victoria Day (that's the due date!), or include an anti-imperialist message in conscientious objection.

* Discuss some of the things you learned along the way. This could be an overview of your favourite things gleaned from your source languages, or it could be a list of all the things you found really interesting that didn’t make it into the final conlang, or even just the biological rabbit-hole you went down because of this prompt.

## Newar

### Nouns
- Basic form: root + derivative-suffix + inflectional-suffix
    - Derivation from verbal, adjectival, adverbial, and nominal bases.  Most derivation is verbal.
    - Inflection for number and case
        - Unmarked singular and marked plural
        - Many cases suffixes also involve a preceing oblique suffix
        - Cases suffixes for nominative (unmarked), agentive, instrumental, ablative, dative, locative, genitive
- Nominal bases can combine to form compounds
    - Nominal compounds are either subordinate, coordinate, or idiomatic
        - Subordinate compounds are determinative ('one who...'), comparative ('which are like...'), appositional ('green + bird = parrot'), numeral ('two + hundred')
        - Coordinate compounds are collective ('wife and husband = spouse') or contrastive ('water and fire = enmity') *(this seems similar to Mandarin)*
        - Idiomatic compounds have a different meaning from the components ('gold + bird = person from whom one can make a profit')
- Pronouns are personal, demonstrative/interrogative, and other
    - Personal pronouns distinguish between first, second, and third persons
        - Personal plural pronouns are formed by adding plural suffix
        - Personal first person pronouns have clusivity distinction
        - Second and third person pronouns have honorific and non-honorific forms
    - Demonstrative pronouns are third person pronouns with remote and proximate distinctions
    - Interrogative pronouns for humans, non-human beings, and non-beings
    - Interrogative pronouns form the base for conjuctive constructions ('John, who...') and indefinite pronouns
    - Demonstrative and interrogative pronouns form distributive plurals through reduplication of the base
- Monomorphemic numerals for 'one' to 'ten' and 'hundred', 'thousand', 'lakh', and 'crore'.  Other numbers are compounds.
    - Some basic numerals occur after nouns to create a specific meaning like measures of distance
    - Teens are formed by 'ten' + /-n-/ + basic numeral
    - Multiples of 10 are formed by basic numeral + reduced form of 'ten'
    - Multiples of 100 or 1,000 are formed by basic numeral + 'hundred'/'thousand'
    - Final basic digit is added where relevant (e.g. 'three-ten four' for 34)
    - Further structures for fractions are listed

### Verbs
- Basic form: root + (causitive) + inflectional-suffix
    - Verbs derive through auxiliary words, not morphological suffixes
    - Verbs do not inflect for person
    - Verbal roots are monosyllabic
- Verbal derivation can be transitivization or causativization
    - Transitivization occurs through voicing changes
    - Causativization occurs through causitive suffix /-k/ and sometimes additionally another preceding suffix
- Verbal inflections
    - Conjunct denotes first-person subject (occurs for past, non-past, and imperative)
    - Disjunct denotes second-person or third-person subjects (occurs for past, non-past, and imperative)
    - Past forms include a proximate/remote suffix (e.g. verbal-base + past-disjunct-suffix + proximate/remote-suffix)
    - Infinitive denotes a verbal noun
    - Past participle takes an auxiliary verb and denotes an incomplete action
    - Habitual denotes habitual actions
- Compound verbs are idiomatic or auxiliary
    - Idiomatic verbs occur as noun followed by a main verb, and has meaning different from components (e.g. 'head + prop(infinitive) = work hard')
    - Auxiliary verbs can denote permissive, causitive, perfective aspect, continuation, beginning of work, or work in advance
        - When joined with an auxiliary verb, the main verb will be in infinitive, past-participle, or habitual form (with different results)

### Adjectives
- Demonstrative and interrogative roots are basically adjectival in function
- Comparatives and superlatives are by adding specific words before the adjective
- Adjectives can be derived from verbs, nouns, or from other adjectives
- Demonstrative bases for proximate-to-addresser, proximate-to-addressee, remote, and extremely-remote
    - Demonstratives can combine with other adjectives to convey a certain amount/degree of that adjective
- Interrogative bases for humans, animate-non-humans and inanimates (including abstract nouns), and locations

### Adverbs
- Simple adverbs are monomorphemic
- Adverbs can be derived from verbal, adjectival, onomatopoeic, and phonesthetic bases
    - Onomatopoeic and phonesthetic bases are used to convey momentary or continuing aspects
    - Base reduplication can convey repeated actions

### Particles and Postpositions
- Particles can convey emphatic, conjunctive, quotative, expletive, negative, prohibitive, benedictive, determinative, exclamatory, hortative, initiative, responsive, vocative, questions, interrogative, honorific, intensifier, nullifier, and sentence nullifier
    - Conjunctive particles are either coordinative or subordinative
        - Coordinative particles can be cumulative ('and'), alternative ('or'), adversative ('even though'), or illative ('therefore')
- Postpositions come after nouns, pronouns, adjectives, certain adverbs, and non-finite verbs to indicate place, direction, source, method, etc.

### Classifiers
- Verbal classifiers convey aspectual distinctions ('once', 'suddenly')
- Nominatal classifiers denote qualities of the noun, and are used when quantifying the noun

### Reduplication
- Interrogative, demonstrative, reflexive, and indefinite nominal/pronominal bases can be reduplicated to convey distributive plural
- Numerals with classifiers can be reduplicated to indicate distributions ('one by one')
- Classifiers without numerals can be reduplicated to indicate emphasized innumerable distribution ('many of X' or 'many times')
- Verbs in past and non-past forms can be reduplicated to bring emphasis
- Verbs in past-participle form can be reduplicated to imply repeated continuous action
- Verbs in imperative and habitual forms can be reduplicated to indicate more intensive action
- Verbs reduplicated with emphatic particle between reduplication indicates intensified repetition of the action
- Verbs in non-finite form can be reduplicated to give sense of continuity of past-participle incompletive form
- Adjectives can be reduplicated to *reduce* intensity ('sour' to 'sourish')
- Adverbs can be reduplicated to indicate repeated action
    - Final syllable can be triplicated to indicate continuous fast action
- Postpositions can be reduplicated to *increase* degree
- Nouns can be reduplicated with slight sound change (echo) to generalize the meaning ('house' to 'houses etc.')

## Sinhala

### Typology
- Highly consistent OV language, with modifiers preceding heads
- Predicates can be verbal or non-verbal
    - Non-verbal predicates do not need a copula
- Clause types classified by verb classes and by number of valency relations
    - Combined with this is an active-inactive dichotomy
- Adjectives do not inflect for degree but take adverbs instead
- More standard identifiers precede variable elements (e.g. family name before given name before title)
- Noun modifiers precede nouns, except for numerals
- Focus can be shifted (emphasized) by moving the focused constituent to the end of the sentence
- Simple questions are formed with question particle or interrogative pronouns
- Negative sentences are formed with negative particles added to the right of the predicate
    - Non-verbal predicates also have other ways to form negation
- Adverbials appear to the left of the predicate
    - Sentence adverbs appear in sentence-initial position
- Aspect and mood always involve an auxiliary verb preceded by the main verb
- Clause combination involves participles, suffixed forms of verbs, and particles
    - Dependant clauses generally preced the main clause
    - Clauses precede the subordinating conjunction
- Although word order is generally SOV, it can be relatively free if there's no ambiguity
- Widespread ellipsis of both subject and object (including dative 'experiencers') when possible
    - Subjects will only be included for emphasis or clarity
    - When a negative marker is present, the entire verbal predicate can be deleted
- Both subject and direct object appear in the unmarked nominative case in active clauses
- Phrases are sometimes repeated with opposite constituent order to emphasize repetition ('he me-DAT hit me-DAT he hit' = 'He hit me repeatedly')
- There are some instances of reduplication, including rhyming expressions reminiscent of Newar echo reduplication

### Nouns
- Nouns inflect for case, definiteness, and number
- Inflection falls into two classes based on animacy
    - Animacy is most obvious in numeral phrases where different number forms are used
- Nouns have 5 cases: Nominative, Accusative, Dative, Instrumental, and Genitive/Locative
    - Accusative is usually optional and is only used for animate nouns
- Definiteness is unmarked, while indefinite nouns take an indefinite marker
- Personal prounouns are classified by person and number
    - Scond person pronouns have three levels of respect/intimacy
- Demonstratives have four deictic levels:
    - Close to speaker
    - Close to addressee
    - Distant but visible to both speaker and addressee
    - Distant and not visible, or anaphoric
- Demonstrative pronouns at each deictic level exist for inanimate nouns, animals (derogatory for humans), and humans
- Interrogative pronouns follow the same pattern as demonstrative pronouns
- Nouns can be derived from verbs
    - Most productive system involves adding particle to verbal adjective
    - Nominalized verb can take slightly different meaning depending on transitivity of verb stem

### Adjectives
- Adjectives occur in three classes: descriptive, nominal, and verbal
    - Descriptive adjectives denote qualities or attributes
    - Nominal adjectives can occur as full-fledged nouns, but do not inflect like nouns when used as adjectives
    - Verbal adjectives denote actions, states, or experiences
    - Nominal and verbal adjectives appear in identical form to the nominative-case nouns and non-past verbs, so they are not "pure adjectives" like descriptive adjectives
- Adjectives can occur predicatively, but require an assertion marker
- Demonstrative pronouns and interrogative pronouns function similar to adjectives syntactically

### Verbs
- Verbs inflect for past tense and non-past tense
- Verbs also occur as one of three types: Active, Passive, and Causative
    - Some verbal stems can occur in all of the three types, but others only create full verbs in a subset of the three
    - This roughly corresponds to a distinction between dynamic/active verbs (Active & Causitive) and stative/processive verbs (Passive)

### Adverbs
- There is an open class of adverbs for indicating time, place, manner, degree, and cause
- Most adverbs are derived from another grammatical category, with a small set of non-derivied primitive forms
- Adverbs can sometimes inflect similar to nouns
- Complex adverbial phrases are created by combining an adjective/noun with another nominal form

### Particles
- Particles are postpositional words without inflection that attach mainly to nominals
    - Case particles connecting nominals to predicate, such as 'by (causitive)'
    - Predicative particles connecting noun phrases to predicate, such as 'throughout'
    - Highlighting particles, such as 'indeed'
    - Conjunctive particles, such as 'or'
    - Discourse particles for textual relationships, such as 'besides'
    - Interrogative particles to form questions
    - Quotative particles after verbal clauses
    - Negative particles

### Affixes
- Prefixes
    - Nouns can be modified, like 'con-' or 'mal-'
    - Adjectives can be modified, like 'very' or 'un-'
    - Verbs can be modified, like 'de-' or 'con-'
- Suffixes
    - Nouns can be modified to denote lexical meanings
    - Adjectives can be modified to denote grammatical meanings like comparative, superlative, nominal sense, and diminutive
    - Verbs can be modified inflectionally to denote verbal actions or verbal objects ('type-writer')

### Interjections
- Interjections are short sudden expressions of emotion, mental attitude, response, or sometimes emphatic effect via reduplication

### Numerals
- Numerals inflect for case, number, and definiteness
- Numerals generally occur as a combination of base forms with particles, suffixes, or measure words
- Lower numerals follow decimal multiples ('100 + 20 + 3') except for teen numbers ('1 + 10', '2 + 10')
- Ordinal numbers are formed by adding a suffix
- When counting animals or humans, numeral classifiers are added to the base before placing it after the noun
- Numerals forms inherently denote definiteness and must be marked for indefinite meanings
- Classifiers appear in singular form while the common noun appears in plural form ('men three-person')
- Measure words are also used with numerals to describe weight, length, duration, etc.
    - Structure of measure phrases is noun + measure word + classified numeral ('bread pounds two')
    - Common nouns can also be used as quantifiers, such as 'bottle' or 'box'
- Two consecutive indefinite numerals denotes alternation between the two ('two or three')

### Kinship terms
- Kinship terms can be extended to the whole society
- Same-gendered siblings use the same terms of address
    - Father and father's brothers all addressed with same term, but mother and father's sisters use different terms ('mother' vs 'aunt')

### Verb morphology
- Verbs are composed of lexical stems and grammatical suffixes to form usable verb forms
- Verbs inflect for tense between past and non-past
- Other finite forms (tied to a specific location in time relative to time of speaking)
    - Imperative mood for commands and requests, usually does not have a suffix
    - Permissive form functions similar to Imperative form but for third-persons (with different suffix)
    - Hortative form functions similar to Imperative form but for first-person plural
    - Optative mood functions like Imperative for first-person, but also changes to intransitive/involitive form
        - A Volitional Optative can also be formed with a different suffix
    - Inferential mood expresses futurity, and is generally used with second-person or third-person subjects
    - Exclamatory mood expresses surprise towards an action
- Non-finite forms are not tied to a specific location in time
    - Adjectival form
    - Focus form
    - Conditional form
    - Concessive form
    - Temporal form
    - Perfect participial form
    - Perfect Adjectival form
    - Reduplicated form
    - Infinitive form
- Although non-finite forms may have past and non-past suffixes, they never express actual past/non-past meaning
    - Instead they depend on the tense of the finite verb for temporality
- Verbs can take passive/intransitive suffix or causitive suffix to change the verb stem
- Verbs can have Active form, Passive form, Causative form, or Causative-passive form
    - Passive form and Causative-passive form are often interchangeable
    - Intransitive stems are transitivized by adding a Causative morpheme
    - Passive forms can be obtained from most Causative forms and function like detransitivization or involitivization
- Basic differentiation of verbs occurs between Active and Passive forms

### Noun morphology
- Nouns are divided into animate and inanimate classes
- Nouns inflect for case, number, and definiteness
- Inanimate nouns inflect for Nominative, Dative, Instrumental, and Locative cases
- Animate nouns inflect for Nominative, Accusative, Dative, Ablative, Genitive, and Vocative cases
    - Accusative case is optional and usually reserved for specific situations
- There are other ways of expressing case besides morphology, such as postpositions and particles
- Nouns inflect for singular and plural
    - For singular animate nouns, a feminine/masculine distinction is sometimes made
    - Number information is sometimes fused with the case information in a single suffix
    - Sometimes nouns add a null suffix (i.e. don't change form) for number
    - Some plural forms mean either genuine plurality ('several mothers') or inclusive plurality ('mother and others')
- Definiteness is unmarked, indefinite meaning must be marked
    - (In)definite suffix usually precedes case suffix
- Nouns can be derived from adjectives or other nouns using suffixes
    - Nouns derived from adjectives inflect for case, number, and definiteness just like ordinary nouns
- Nouns can be derived from verbs using suffixes
- Nouns can take prefixes that affect qualities of the noun but don't affect the lexical category
- Nouns can form compounds, where the head noun appears on the right
    - Only the head noun undergoes case inflection
    - Adjectival compounds ('red' + 'flowers' = 'a certain species of red flower')
    - Numeral compounds ('two' + 'period in the day' = 'morning and evening')
        - The order of numeral and noun is opposite of typical numeral phrases
    - Collective compounds ('fly' + 'mosquito' = 'bugs')
    - Opposite compounds ('take' + 'give' = 'transactions')
    - Rhyme compounds ('car' + nonsense rhyme = 'vehicles')
    - Idiomatic compounds, with meaning unrelated to components ('three' + 'five' = 'blended spice')
    - Compounds are abundant and can be formed with more than just two components

### Reduplication
- Verbs can be reduplicated to perform different syntactic or semantic functions
    - Infinitive form reduplicated to denote iterativity or continuity
    - Past participle form reduplicated to denote iterativity or durativity
    - Past participial form with additional suffix reduplicated to denote only iterativity
    - Verbal adjectives reduplicated to express individuality and emphasis
- Adjectives and adverbs reduplicated to intensify
- Nouns reduplicated to denote graduality, separateness, or plurality

### Argument structure
- Predicate occupies the final position in the sentence
- Constituents are ommited when the referent is understood
    - Second-person pronouns are often replaced by names, titles, or kinship terms
- Argument structure types are classified by the following criteria:
    - Class of predicate
    - Lexical-semantic character of predicate
    - Lexical-semantic character of nominal arguments
    - Grammatical markings
    - Relative prominence of participants
- Possible argument structure types are enumerated in table on page 101 of the reference grammar
- Copula is not required for predication
- Noun phrases that do not qualify as arguments of the predicate are used optionally to modify the predicate
    - Dative is used for purpose, source, time, standard, etc.
    - Instrumental/ablative is used for instrument, duration of time, and various sources
    - Locative is used for location of activity or of states
    - Genitive is used for possessive relationships between one noun phrase and another noun phrase
        - Only used for animate nouns; locative case is used for inanimate nouns
    - Vocative is not used within a sentence but rather to address a referent
- Postpositional phrases convey spatial meanings, and follow their referent
- Case markings do not indicate relations like subject and object
    - Subjects can be in nominative, accusative, dative, or instrumental case depending on the situation
    - For this reason, Sinhala has been described as being ergative
    - The subject is better identified by the focus system (described later)
    - Case marking mainly depends on the lexical requirements of the predicate, particularly theta roles (volitivity)
- When an animate/human noun takes an unaccustomed role (i.e. undergoer) it is marked with the accusative

### Phrase construction
- Noun phrases are connected through case markings
- Modifiers of nouns can be nouns, adjectives, or verbs
    - Word order is critical to interpretting these phrases, with head noun occuring at the end of the phrase
    - Verbal modifiers appear in adjectival form
- Relative clauses are verb-final, so they don't need extra connecting morphemes
    - Relative clauses use a gapping strategy, so there is no overt indication of the relative relationship between clauses (no pronouns or particles)
    - Relative clauses can be embedded within other relative clauses using the case system
- Verb phrase modifiers can occur both before and after the the verb
    - Interrogative particle can occur sentence-initially or sentence-finally
    - Negative particle is added after the predicate
    - Negation of individual segments of the sentence occur before the negated segment as a prefix
- Some auxiliary verbs occur after the principal verb (in the perfect participle form)
    - For example, 'child wet-PAST' = 'the child wet something', but 'child wet-PP take-PAST' = 'this child wet himself'
    - Sinhala reflexives have a strong non-volitional sense
- Certain verbs and adjectives are used as modal auxiliaries
    - Necessitative mood comes from Infinitive verb + 'be'/'become'
        - Animate participants appear in dative form to reinforce non-volitional obligation
    - Deontic and epistemic mood comes from Infinitive verb + 'need/want'
        - Participant in dative form expresses desire
        - Participant in nominative form expresses deontic obligation
    - Ability/possibility comes from Infinitive verb + 'able' with dative subject
- Tense appears as past or non-past, but can convey more nuanced aspects depending on the verbs type (Active, Passive, Causitive)
- Adjectives do not inflect for tense even if they are predicates
    - Instead the adjective is nominalized with dative/instrumental case, and an inflected copula is added
- Non-finite verbs depend on finite clauses for their location in time
- Aspectual distinctions are indicated with Perfect Participle verb + auxiliary verb
    - Aspects include perfective, resultative, completive, inchoative, processive, progressive, and inceptive, all with their own respective auxiliary verbs
