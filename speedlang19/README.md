## Prompt

### Process

* Choose a clade (taxon) of organisms. This clade shouldn’t be so broad it's at the level of a kingdom or phylum, but it also shouldn’t be so narrow as a subspecies. Something around within the family-genus range should do nicely, though you could wiggle away from that range as needed.

* Choose 2-6 locations representative of this clade. For a fossil clade, this could be the locations of major palaeontological finds; for a modern clade this could include regions where the clade likely first evolved or originated, or where it has the highest degree of biodiversity. Alternatively, you could just pick your favourite (sub)species and the regions where they’re found. These regions should ideally be fairly confined locations: if a species has, for example, a circumpolar distribution, then choose a subspecies that’s limited to the Canadian Archipelago, or Fennoscandia, or Kamchatka, etc.

* Choose 3-6 languages based on these locations. For each region, find some literature on a language indigenous to that area. If there are a few languages indigenous to the region, you can pick all of them or whichever seems like it’ll be easiest to work with. If you can’t find good material for languages indigenous to the region, you can look at closely related languages, just don’t go too far away.

    * Make sure at least 2 languages are from different language macrofamilies. The majority of your languages can be from the same family, but there should be at least one wildcard. For example, if your clade is fairly well confined to south-east Asia, you might have mostly Austroasiatic languages, but you should also include at least one Sino-Tibetan or Austronesian language from the region that makes sense.

* Create a conlang based on these languages. Every phonological and grammatical decision you make should be clearly motivated or inspired by something present in the natural languages selected above. You are also free to make extrapolations therefrom: as you develop, it may make sense to make a decision based on what you’ve already drafted for the conlang so far, even if it’s not directly rooted in any of the natural languages. This is encouraged and the thesis of my Segments article. For instance, applying a morphophonological process from one language to a phonemic series of another language could create a phone that is not present in either, or you might co-opt a morphosyntactic structure from one language to help mark something pragmatic from another language, etc.

* Include at least one phoneme inspired by your clade. This phone could be anything, both human-capable or not, so long as its inclusion is because of the clade: pantherans might have a sub-laryngeal roar, pelecaniforms might have a rostral percussive, alpheids might have manual cavitations, and salicoids might have something psithuristic. This segment need not even be a phone and could be visual, pheromonal, or something else, so long as it contributes to word meaning.

### Tasks

* Document and showcase your language, making sure to illustrate how you met each step or restriction along the way.

* Translate and gloss at least five (5) example sentences from acceptable sources: syntax tests from Zephyrus (z!stest &c) or sentences from Mareck’s 5 Minutes of Your Day activity (make sure to note which ones).

* Showcase at least 12 lexical items and at least 2 conceptual metaphors directly inspired by your clade in some way. For example: if the clade is flight-capable, then they might have some specific flight vocabulary; if they have shells, then they might have some specific shell-sense vocabulary or simple roots for each shell segment; plants might have a very different concept of death than we do; pelagic sharks might consider swimming and breathing to be synonymous.

* For extra brownie points, include a Star Wars easter egg for May the 4th (that's today!), or include a Star Trek easter egg in conscientious objection.

* For even more brownie points, exalt a queen for Victoria Day (that's the due date!), or include an anti-imperialist message in conscientious objection.

* Discuss some of the things you learned along the way. This could be an overview of your favourite things gleaned from your source languages, or it could be a list of all the things you found really interesting that didn’t make it into the final conlang, or even just the biological rabbit-hole you went down because of this prompt.
