# My First Language

_by armytag_

## Goals

 - Create several rudimentary languages to test many ideas without feeling constrained to fit everything to a common linguistic form.
 - Allow mixing of ideas between languages
 - Potentially spin off best ideas into more details languages

## Psuedo-culture

 - Several groups find themselves on a space station trying to figure out how they ended up there.

## Template: Language Goals

1. **Endgoal:** Complete entire process of creating a language
2. **Vague Phrase:** Intuitive brevity
3. **Naturalism:** Somewhat naturalistic (6/10)
4. **Complexity:** Medium complexity, explore a variety of techniques
5. **Derivation:** Use non-concatenative morphology in a few places
6. **Phonological Features:** 
    - something
7. **Grammar Features:**
    - Widespread use of pro-forms, aggressively drop pro-forms when possible
    - Many grammatical voices for valency manipulation
    - Case marking (?)
8. **Culture Features:** 
    - something

## Phonological Ideas

 - No voicing (CVCVCV) > intervocalic voicing (CVCVCV) > lose some vowels (e.g. finals) (CVCVC)
