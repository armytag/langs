# My First Language

_by armytag_

## Goals

 - Create several rudimentary languages to test many ideas without feeling constrained to fit everything to a common linguistic form.
 - Allow mixing of ideas between languages
 - Potentially spin off best ideas into more details languages

## Psuedo-culture

 - Several groups find themselves on a space station trying to figure out how they ended up there.
