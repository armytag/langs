## Phonology

### Consonants

- Consonant count: moderately large (26-33)
- Voicing in plosives
- Missing some of /p t k b d g/, but not exactly /p/, /g/, or both
- Has bilabials, fricatives, and nasals
- No clicks, labial-velars, pharyngeals, or 'th' sounds
- No uvulars
- No glottals
- Lateral /l/ and obstruents
- Velar nasal initially

| CONSONANTS     | Labial | Alveolar | Velar |
|---             |---     |---       |---    |
| Nassals        | m̥ m    | n̥ n      | ŋ̊ ŋ   |
| Plosives       | p b    | t        | k g   |
| Lab. Plosives  | pʷ bʷ  | tʷ       | kʷ gʷ |
| Pal. Plosives  | pʲ bʲ  | tʲ       | kʲ gʲ |
| Fricatives     | f      | s        | x     |
| Trill          |        | r        |       |
| Laterals       |        | ɬ l      |       |

Count: 27 consonants

Romanization:
- Labialized plosives written with followinɡ 'w'
  - /pʷ/ 'pw', /tʷ/ 'tw', etc.
- Palatalized plosives written with followinɡ 'y'
  - /pʲ/ 'py', /tʲ/ 'ty', etc.
- Velar nasal /ŋ/ written as 'nj'
- Voiceless nasals and lateral fricative written with preceding 'h'
  - /m̥/ 'hm', /ŋ̊/ 'hnj', /ɬ/ 'hl', etc.
 
### Vowels

- Vowel count: small (2-4)
- No vowel nasalization

| VOWELS | Front | Central | Back |
|---     |---    |---      |---   |
| High   | i     |         | u    |
| Mid    |       | ə (e)   |      |
| Low    |       | a       |      |

Count: 4 vowels

Romanization:
- Schwa /ə/ written as 'e'

### Syllables

Syllables moderately complex (CVC)

- Onset combinations: nassals, plosives, fricatives, liquids (27)
- Nucleus: vowels (4)
- Coda: voiced nasals, voiced trill, fricatives, and laterals (9)

Syllables written as a sequence of consonant characters 
with a sinɡle vowel character for /ɑ/ appearinɡ in between 
(other vowels inferrable from context)

Stress always falls on second syllable of word
 
## Morphology

### Nouns

- Nouns not inflected for anything
- Nominal plural is indicated through pluralizing particle 'tyan'
- Associative nouns ("John and his associates") same as normal plural
- Pronominal and adnominal demonstratives are the same 
  - "*this* book", "I don't like *that*"
- All demonstratives ("this" and "that") can be used as third person pronouns
- Intensifiers and reflexive pronouns distinct
- Commitatives and instrumentals use different words (English "with")
- Ordinal numerals are distinct for the first few numbers, derived after that
- Distributive numerals ("one each") marked by reduplication ("one one")
- Sortable numeral classifiers are absent (this is like English)
- Conjuctions and universal quantifiers are formally similar
  - Could use a widely productive word that is used in many situations
  - Could have universal quantifiers derive from conjuctions
- Adjectives can occur without specific noun, but need a preceding marker
- Action nominals ("the city's destruction") are not allowed
  - Can be achieved through subordinate clauses, clause nominalization, etc.
- Noun conjugator "and" and commitative conjugator "with" are identical
- Noun conjugation and verb conjugation are largely identical

### Pronouns
- Pronouns inflect for number, clusivity, and case (NOM, ACC, or GEN)
- Plural pronouns also take the pluralizing particle/affix
- Idefinite pronouns ("someone", "something") derived from interrogatives

| PRONOUNS | NOM      | Affix  | OBL      | Clitic | GEN    |
|---       |---       |---     |---       |---     |---     |
| 1SG      | hnja     | -nji   | hnja     | =njar  | hnjanj |
| 1PL.INC  | tu tyan  | -ti    | re tyan  | =na    | tenj   |
| 1PL.EXC  | xa tyan  | -ki    | gya tyan | =ga    | bya    |
| 2SG      | fe       | -pe    | pwax     | =pwa   | pix    |
| 2PL      | bwa tyan | -be    | bwa tyan | =ba    | bihl   |
| 3SG      | bes      | -hla   | hmuhl    | =hma   | man    |
| 3PL      | pu tyan  | -le    | pu tyan  | =le    | lam    |

### Verbs

- No tense/aspect marking
- Marked for person (number and clusivity) of both A and P
  - Order of A and P modifiers occur in both orders
    - A modifier is an enclitic that attaches to first word in verb phrase
  - Active alignment (S acts like A or P depending on context)
- Verb affixes **only** mark person
- Purpose clauses have deranked verb forms (e.g. no person marking)
- "When" clauses balanced (same verb markings)
- Reason clauses balanced (same verb markings)

### Aspects

| ASPECTS | Word |
|---      |---   |
| RL.IMP  | kwa  |
| IR.IMP  | pi   |
| IR.PRF  | hna  |

| ASPECTS  | Unmarked | RL.IMP | IR.IMP | IR.PRF |
|---       |---       |---     |---     |---     |
| Unmarked | PERF     | IMPF   | ANTC   | INTL   |
| RL.IMP   | IMPF     | -      | HAB    | NECS   |
| IR.IMP   | ANTC     | HAB    | -      | INCP   |
| IR.PRF   | INTL     | NECS   | INCP   | -      |

**Need to revisit RL.IMP + IR.PRF combination**

## Grammar

### Word Order

- Generally SVO
- Pre.N
- Gen.N (Poss.N)
- N.Adj
- N.Dem
- N.Num
- N.Rel
- Adj.Deg and Deg.Adj
  - Can be different if adjective is attributive or predicative
  - "I very handsome" vs "I became handsome very"
- Question word at end of phrase
- Interrogative word at beginning of phrase ("Who is ...")
- Multiple subordinator structures
  - Could use multiple words like Chinese "Ruguo ... dehua, ..."
  - Kathmandu Newari apparently uses multiple structures; use as reference
- Negative particle at end of phrase (SVONeg)
  - Negation also has another asymmetric form
    - Could be related to subordinator structures
    - Could depend on or change grammatical structures in sentence
- No definite or indefinite articles
- Aspect indicated with preceding particle
- Tense indicated with following time phrase
- Ditransitive encoded with prepositions
- **Need to consider causitive phrases**
- Negative indefinite pronouns always occur with predicate negation 
  - "_nobody doesn't_ read news" (opposite of English)
- Nominal and locational predicates encoded the same way
  - "John _is_ tall" and "John _is_ in Paris"
- Comparative constructions use locational syntax
- Possesion denoted with a dedicated transitive verb ("have")
- Predicative adjectives have mixed encoding
  - Verbal coding is usually for temporary adjectives
- Non-reductive subject relativization
- Obliques cannot be relativized
- Desiderative markers on verb

### Possesives

Possesives are marked by a specially inflected pronoun e.g. "John his book"
