## Phonology

### Consonants

- Consonant count: average (19-25)
- Voicing in plosives
- Plosives /p t k b d g/
- Has bilabials, fricatives, and nasals
- No clicks, labial-velars, pharyngeals, or 'th' sounds
- No uvulars
- No glottals
- Lateral /l/, no obstruents
- No velar nasal

| CONSONANTS   | Labial | Alveolar | Retroflex | Velar |
|---           |---     |---       |---        |---    |
| Nassals      | m      |          |           |       |
| Plosives     | p b    | t d      | ʈ ɖ       | k g   |
| Labialized   | pʷ bʷ  | tʷ dʷ    | ʈʷ ɖʷ     | kʷ gʷ |
| Fricatives   | f      | s        |           | x     |
| Approximants |        | l        |           |       |

Count: 21 consonants

Romanization:
- Retroflex written with alveolar equivalent followed by 'r'
  - /ʈ/ 'tr', /ɖ/ 'dr'
- Labialized plosives written with followinɡ 'w'
  - /tʷ/ 'tw', /ʈʷ/ 'trw', etc.
 
### Vowels

- Vowel count: average (5-6)
- Vowel nasalization

| VOWELS  | Front | Back |
|---      |---    |---   |
| Hiɡh    | i     | u    |
| Low     | e     | o    |
| Nasal   | ɛ̃     | ɔ̃    |

Count: 6 vowels

Romanization:
- Nasal vowels written with followinɡ 'n'
  - /ɛ̃/ 'en', /ɔ̃/ 'on'

### Syllables

Syllables moderately complex (CVC)

- Onset combinations: nassals, plosives, lateral approximants (18)
- Nucleus: vowels (6)
- Coda: fricatives and approximants (5)

Syllables written as onset-vowel character with smaller coda characters 
(labialized plosives match unlabialized characters with a diacritic)
- (10 onset * 6 vowels) + 6 lone vowels + 4 coda = 70 unique characters

Alternatively, could write with onset character and rime character
- 10 onset + 6 lone vowels + (6 vowels * 4 coda) = 40 unique characters
 
## Morphology

### Nouns

- Nouns not inflected for anything
  - Pronouns inflect for number, clusivity, and case (NOM, ACC, or GEN)
- Nominal plural is indicated through a pluralizing particle/affix
  - Plural pronouns also take the pluralizing particle/affix

### Verbs

- Past/non-past distinction
  - Tense coded with combination of morphological strategies
- Marked for person of both A and P
  - Order of A and P modifiers occur in both orders

## Grammar

### Word Order

- Generally SVO
- Pre.N
- Gen.N (Poss.N)
- N.Adj
- N.Dem
- N.Num
- N.Rel
- Adj.Deg and Deg.Adj
  - Can be different if adjective is attributive or predicative
  - "I very handsome" vs "I became handsome very"
- Question word at end of phrase
- Interrogative word at beginning of phrase ("Who is ...")
- Multiple subordinator structures
  - Could use multiple words like Chinese "Ruguo ... dehua, ..."
  - Kathmandu Newari apparently uses multiple structures; use as reference
- Negative particle at end of phrase (SVONeg)
  - Negation also has another asymmetric form
    - Could be related to subordinator structures
    - Could depend on or change grammatical structures in sentence
- No definite or indefinite articles

Possesives are marked by a specially inflected pronoun e.g. "John his book"
