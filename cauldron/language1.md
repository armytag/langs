## Phonology

### Consonants

- Consonant count: average (19-25)
- Voicing in plosives
- Plosives /p t k b d g/
- Has bilabials, fricatives, and nasals
- No clicks, labial-velars, pharyngeals, or 'th' sounds
- No uvulars
- No glottals
- Lateral /l/, no obstruents
- No velar nasal

| CONSONANTS   | Labial | Alveolar | Retroflex | Velar |
|---           |---     |---       |---        |---    |
| Nassals      | m      |          |           |       |
| Plosives     | p b    | t d      | ʈ ɖ       | k g   |
| Labialized   | pʷ bʷ  | tʷ dʷ    | ʈʷ ɖʷ     | kʷ gʷ |
| Fricatives   | f      | s        |           | x     |
| Approximants |        | l        |           |       |

Count: 21 consonants

Romanization:
- Retroflex written with alveolar equivalent followed by 'r'
  - /ʈ/ 'tr', /ɖ/ 'dr'
- Labialized plosives written with followinɡ 'w'
  - /tʷ/ 'tw', /ʈʷ/ 'trw', etc.
 
### Vowels

- Vowel count: average (5-6)
- Vowel nasalization

| VOWELS  | Front | Back |
|---      |---    |---   |
| Hiɡh    | i     | u    |
| Low     | e     | o    |
| Nasal   | ɛ̃     | ɔ̃    |

Count: 6 vowels

Romanization:
- Nasal vowels written with followinɡ 'n'
  - /ɛ̃/ 'en', /ɔ̃/ 'on'

### Syllables

Syllables moderately complex (CVC)

- Onset combinations: nassals, plosives, lateral approximants (18)
- Nucleus: vowels (6)
- Coda: fricatives and approximants (5)

Syllables written as onset-vowel character with smaller coda characters 
(labialized plosives match unlabialized characters with a diacritic)
- (10 onset * 6 vowels) + 6 lone vowels + 4 coda = 70 unique characters

Alternatively, could write with onset character and rime character
- 10 onset + 6 lone vowels + (6 vowels * 4 coda) = 40 unique characters
 
## Morphology

### Nouns

- Nouns not inflected for anything
  - Pronouns inflect for number, clusivity, and case (NOM, ACC, or GEN)
- Nominal plural is indicated through a pluralizing particle/affix
  - Plural pronouns also take the pluralizing particle/affix
- Associative nouns ("John and his associates") same as normal plural
- Pronominal and adnominal demonstratives are the same 
  - "*this* book", "I don't like *that*"
- All demonstratives ("this" and "that") can be used as third person pronouns
- Idefinite pronouns ("someone", "something") derived from interrogatives
- Intensifiers and reflexive pronouns distinct
- Commitatives and instrumentals use different words (English "with")
- Ordinal numerals are distinct for the first few numbers, derived after that
- Distributive numerals ("one each") marked by reduplication ("one one")
- Sortable numeral classifiers are absent (this is like English)
- Conjuctions and universal quantifiers are formally similar
  - Could use a widely productive word that is used in many situations
  - Could have universal quantifiers derive from conjuctions
- Adjectives can occur without specific noun, but need a preceding marker
- Action nominals ("the city's destruction") are not allowed
  - Can be achieved through subordinate clauses, clause nominalization, etc.
- Noun conjugator "and" and commitative conjugator "with" are identical
- Noun conjugation and verb conjugation are largely identical

### Verbs

- No tense/aspect marking
- Marked for person (number and clusivity) of both A and P
  - Order of A and P modifiers occur in both orders
    - Could depend on P.Num of A and P
    - 2SG.A-3PL.P-verb, but 3PL.P-verb-1PL.INC.A
  - Active alignment (S acts like A or P depending on context)
- Purpose clauses have deranked verb forms (e.g. no person marking)
- "When" clauses balanced (same verb markings)
- Reason clauses balanced (same verb markings)

## Grammar

### Word Order

- Generally SVO
- Pre.N
- Gen.N (Poss.N)
- N.Adj
- N.Dem
- N.Num
- N.Rel
- Adj.Deg and Deg.Adj
  - Can be different if adjective is attributive or predicative
  - "I very handsome" vs "I became handsome very"
- Question word at end of phrase
- Interrogative word at beginning of phrase ("Who is ...")
- Multiple subordinator structures
  - Could use multiple words like Chinese "Ruguo ... dehua, ..."
  - Kathmandu Newari apparently uses multiple structures; use as reference
- Negative particle at end of phrase (SVONeg)
  - Negation also has another asymmetric form
    - Could be related to subordinator structures
    - Could depend on or change grammatical structures in sentence
- No definite or indefinite articles


### Possesives

Possesives are marked by a specially inflected pronoun e.g. "John his book"
