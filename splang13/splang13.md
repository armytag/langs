## Ideas

- Possible vowel distinctions
    - Height
    - Backness
    - Rounding
    - Tenseness
        - R-coloring for open vowels
    - ~~Nasalization~~
    - ~~Length~~
    - ~~Pharyngealization~~
    - ~~Creaky voice~~ -> use with tones
    - ~~Breathy voice~~ -> use with tones?
- Explore what conjugation and serial verb constructions can mean

## Phonology

### Consonants

### Vowels

|             | Front U | Front R | Back U | Back R |
| ----------- | ------- | ------- | ------ | ------ |
| Close Tense |       i |       y |      ɯ |      u |
| Open Tense  |       ɛ |         |      ʌ |      ɔ |
| Close Lax   |       ɨ |       ʉ |      ɤ |      ʊ |
| Open Lax    |      ə˞ |         |     ɑ˞ |     ɔ˞ |

### Tones

## Rules (for reference)

### Phonology

- Observe **No Nasal November**. Nasal vowels and allophonic nasalization are fine. Phonemic nasal stops are forbidde(n).
- Have **four-dimensional vowels** which means it has to have five-dimensional speakers right? Nah, What I mean is that you have to have at least four contrastive features in your vowels. Not every possible one of the 2⁴ vowels has to exist, but you have to have a minimal pair for each of the four features.
- Have **tone sandhi or mutations** where a word’s pitch/tone pattern changes in response to its phonological or grammatical environment. That also means you have to uh...have tone.

### Grammar

- Observe **No Noun-inflectional-affixes November**. Nouns may not take affixes to inflect for anything. Stem alterations, suprasegmental stuff, and derivational affixes are fine.
- Have a **closed adjective class**. You can have other modifiers, but you have to show that they aren’t a member of the adjective class.
- Make use of **serial verb constructions**, in which multiple verbs can occur as a single predicate without showing marks of subordination or coordination.

## Tasks

1. Document and showcase your language, explaining and demonstrating how it meets all of the elements of the challenge.
2. Translate and gloss at least five example sentences. You can either get “syntax test sentences” by asking Zephyrus “z!stest” (RIP Leonard), in which case note down which number sentences you get, or you can pick from recent ‘Just Used 5 Minutes of your Day’ challenges posted by u/mareck_ on r/conlangs, in which case note which number 5moyds you do.
3. List out all of your language’s adjectives and define them. I don’t just mean give an English gloss, but really define them!
4. Come up with at least five idioms, define them, and give examples of their use. Bonus points for creative etymologies.
5. Come up with at least five derivational strategies and give examples of each.
6. (Optional) Do Lexember with your speedlang!
