# Prompts

[^1]: Include tone and/or phonation that is contrastive on the level of the word or lower. This could be tone/phonation that works on a word, foot, syllable, or mora level.
[^2]: Have some asymmetries between the set of consonants allowed to occur in the onset and coda, meaning that either more or less consonants are allowed in the onset than in the coda, or having consonants that only occur in either the onset or the coda. ***Bonus***: have restrictions specific for clusters that are different to the constraints for initial onsets and final codas.
[^3]: Include at least two different strategies for resolving clusters or hiatus at morpheme boundaries, distinct from how clusters or hiatus are resolved within roots. These strategies must both be synchronically active.
[^4]: Have a closed or near-closed set of words within a broader class (nouns, adjectives, verbs, demonstratives, numerals, etc) that take more and/or unique inflectional morphology. Morphology here could be stem alternations (gradation/consonant mutation/apophony), or tone changes, not necessarily affixes. How small this set of words is isn’t really important, as long as it does not constitute a majority of a given class. – ***Bonus***: do this with more than one class.
[^5]: Have more than one morpheme that are complete homophones with at least one other, but appear in different contexts. This does not have to be an affix or alternation, and could be two or more grammatical morphemes that are simply homophones with each other.
[^6]: Create at least two dialects, each of which differs from the main language in at least three grammatical or phonological features. These features need not be the same across dialects, but each dialect should have at least three clear distinguishing features from the main language. These dialects can be as distinct or similar to the main language, as long as they are still intelligible. Denote throughout your description where the dialects differ from the main language. – ***Bonus***: create one or more sociolects/registers (as opposed to a geographically distinct dialect).
[^7]: Translate 5x 5MOYD (Just Used 5 Minutes of Your Day) or Conlang Syntax Test Cases sentences.
