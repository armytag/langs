## Phonology

| CONSONANTS  | Labial | Alveolar | Velar | Glottal |
| ---         | ---    | ---      | ---   | ---     |
| Nasal       | m      | n        |       |         |
| Vcl. Stop   | p      | t        | k     |         |
| Vcd. Stop   | b      | d        | g     |         |
| Fricative   |        | s        | x     | h       |
| Approximant | w      | l        | j     |         |

1. Include tone and/or phonation that is contrastive on the level of the word or lower. This could be tone/phonation that works on a word, foot, syllable, or mora level.
    1. Breathy voice patterns at word or foot level (breathy-creaky vs. creaky-breathy)
        - Word-level: dʱa̤la̤ | ta̰la̰
        - Foot-level: dʱa̤la̰ | ta̰la̤
    2. Breathy/creaky voice evolving from stress system
        - ˈdago → ˈda.gʱo̤
        - daˈgol → daˈgo
2. Have some asymmetries between the set of consonants allowed to occur in the onset and coda, meaning that either more or less consonants are allowed in the onset than in the coda, or having consonants that only occur in either the onset or the coda. ***Bonus***: have restrictions specific for clusters that are different to the constraints for initial onsets and final codas.
    1. Initial onset: No approximants
    1. Final coda: Only stops
    1. Clusters: Can have nasal-stop and C-approximant clusters
3. Include at least two different strategies for resolving clusters or hiatus at morpheme boundaries, distinct from how clusters or hiatus are resolved within roots. These strategies must both be synchronically active.

- 15-18 consonants
- 5-6 vowels
- Voicing contrast in plosives only
- Other voicing/gaps in plosives
    - Does not have all of /p, t, k, b, d, g/
    - Not simply missing /p/, /g/, or both
- No uvulars
- Ejectives
- No laterals
- No velar nasal
- Contrastive nasal vowels
- No front rounded vowels
- Moderately complex syllables structure
- Complex tone (?)
    - Probably go with 3 level tones
- Bilabials, nasals, and fricatives all present
- Pharyngeals
- Both Right-edge and unbounded stress (if H exists in bounded right-edge, use that system; otherwise use an unbounded system of some kind)
    - E.g. LHH́L, LHH́H, LH́LL, ĹLLL
    - Long vowels heavy
    - No rhythm/secondary stress
    - Examples
        1. pátaka, páːtaka, paːtáːka, paːtaːkáː

## Modifiers

- Nouns can appear together in apposition to form a more specific meaning of the combined noun
    - This is frequently done with property nouns to specify color, shape, etc. of the other noun(s)
        - Some property nouns are used so commonly they have become like classifiers
    - Articles define the boundary between noun phrases, as well as there specificity/definiteness
    - Abstract nouns can be derived from root nouns
- Some properties are predicated by default, using a small class of stative verbs for:
    - Size
    - Age

### Examples

1. bird COP blue "The bird is blue."
1. bird COP DEF blue "The bird is the blue one."
1. DEF blue COP bird "The blue one is a bird."
1. blue eat bug "The blue one eats a bug." *if following the previous sentence, 'blue' would be understood to refer to the bird*
1. bird big "The bird is big."
1. bird REL big eat bug "The big bird eats a bug." *literally "The bird which bigs eats a bug."*

# Prompts

[^1]: Include tone and/or phonation that is contrastive on the level of the word or lower. This could be tone/phonation that works on a word, foot, syllable, or mora level.
[^2]: Have some asymmetries between the set of consonants allowed to occur in the onset and coda, meaning that either more or less consonants are allowed in the onset than in the coda, or having consonants that only occur in either the onset or the coda. ***Bonus***: have restrictions specific for clusters that are different to the constraints for initial onsets and final codas.
[^3]: Include at least two different strategies for resolving clusters or hiatus at morpheme boundaries, distinct from how clusters or hiatus are resolved within roots. These strategies must both be synchronically active.
[^4]: Have a closed or near-closed set of words within a broader class (nouns, adjectives, verbs, demonstratives, numerals, etc) that take more and/or unique inflectional morphology. Morphology here could be stem alternations (gradation/consonant mutation/apophony), or tone changes, not necessarily affixes. How small this set of words is isn’t really important, as long as it does not constitute a majority of a given class. – ***Bonus***: do this with more than one class.
[^5]: Have more than one morpheme that are complete homophones with at least one other, but appear in different contexts. This does not have to be an affix or alternation, and could be two or more grammatical morphemes that are simply homophones with each other.
[^6]: Create at least two dialects, each of which differs from the main language in at least three grammatical or phonological features. These features need not be the same across dialects, but each dialect should have at least three clear distinguishing features from the main language. These dialects can be as distinct or similar to the main language, as long as they are still intelligible. Denote throughout your description where the dialects differ from the main language. – ***Bonus***: create one or more sociolects/registers (as opposed to a geographically distinct dialect).
[^7]: Translate 5x 5MOYD (Just Used 5 Minutes of Your Day) or Conlang Syntax Test Cases sentences.
