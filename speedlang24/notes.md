### Phonotactics

- C: any consonant, V: any vowel,
- Unstressed syllable: (C)(ʋ)V
- Stressed syllable: C(ʋ)VC

### Noun Cases

- 'static' for contextual referants
- 'dynamic' for nouns involved in the action
- 'relative' for associating noun phrases together
- 'topical/vocative' for highlighting the topic of discourse, or to address someone

### Relator Nouns

Like prepositions, but can also head noun phrases in their own right and otherwise appear without other nouns.  Can occur before a determiner to modify a noun, or after a determiner to modify the phrase.

### Positionals (?)

Like Mayan positionals, describes the internal orientation of a noun.  Can be used to specify nouns in context of a specific action (adverbially), or to generally describe the noun (adjectivally).

### "Dual" Verb Form

Verbs can reduplicate the body (not coda) of the first syllable in the root in order to indicate an action occuring a second time.

### TAM(E)

- Tense marked by ambiguous words (might be inflected or uninflected, or both?)
- Aspect marked by inflected words (auxiliaries, not predicate verb)
- Mood marked on the verb (maybe in combination with a separate word)
- No evidential marking

### Syntax

- OV order and postpositions

## Requirements

### Phonology

1. [x] No diphthongs, but allow adjacent vowels.
1. [x] Voicing must be a contrastive feature, but at only one POA.
1. [x] Have a stress system, but have the stressed syllable be different more than merely in prominence. Maybe more vowel contrasts are allowed in stressed syllables; maybe stressed syllables have (or can have) different phonation; maybe stressed syllables carry tone (including contour tones); etc. You can call this 'pitch accent' if you like.
1. [x] Don't include /w j/.

### Morphology

1. [x] Have a 'dual form' for verbs. Interpret this how you will.
1. [ ] Have a normal-ish set of TAM(E) distinctions, and then exactly 1x weird outlier. For example, normal-ish TAM(E) distinctions might be past/non-past and perfective/imperfective; but then a weird outlier could be a TAM used only for events seen in visions.
1. [x] Nouns have at least 3x cases, and 2x of the cases must be called 'static' and 'dynamic'. Interpret this how you will.
1. [ ] Use 'inversion' on nouns or verbs (or both) to indicate something. By 'inversion' I mean swap the vowels, or invert the tone contour, or swap the MOA or POA of some consonants etc. Could be used to indicate plurality, pluractionality, TAME, possession, definiteness, etc. Use your imagination.
1. [ ] Somewhere, include deliberate ambiguity (nouns/verbs that don't change form; syncretism in agreement markers or cases; etc.)

### Other

1. [ ] There needs to be a 'diminutive register'. Interpret this how you will. Describe how it works, when it is used, and how it differs in morphology/lexicon from normal speech.
1. [ ] Translate 5x SMOYD or other sentences

### Vocabulary

1. [ ] Have a weird colour/texture term (could be very specific, or very vague, like 'red and rubbery' or 'blonde but also maybe reddish-brown or coppery'). Bonus if it means a different thing in different collocations.
1. [ ] Include two sets of words that exhibit sound symbolism. For example, in English a bunch of words beginning gl- have to do with light: gleam, glimmer, glint, glare, glow, gloaming, glisten; and sl- have to do with wetness: slip, slide, slug, slick, slop, slush, slurp, slobber. You need to make 2x sets of at least 3x words in each set. You cannot use sound symbolism for wetness or light.

### Bonus

1. [ ] Include easter eggs from a book/movie you like or the last book/movie you read/watched.
1. [ ] Use the attached picture of an asemic text sample as a basis for a writing system.
