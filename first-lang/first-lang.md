# My First Language

_by armytag_

## Goals

1. **Endgoal:** Complete entire process of creating a language
2. **Vague Phrase:** Intuitive brevity
3. **Naturalism:** Somewhat naturalistic (6/10)
4. **Complexity:** Medium complexity, explore a variety of techniques
5. **Derivation:** Use non-concatenative morphology in a few places
6. **Phonological Features:** 
    - something
7. **Grammar Features:**
    - Widespread use of pro-words, aggressively drop pro-words when possible
    - Develop copula from non-verb origin (like Mandarin)
8. **Culture Features:** 
    - something

## Word Order

- SOV
- SO[V-Neg] _Negative suffix after verb_
- Noun before Relative Clause

## Copula Evolution

Copula can evolve from a relativizing word at the end of relative clauses, for example:

- "John, that student, he studies." -> "John, that student. He studies." -> "John that(COP) student"

This requires certain conditions for the evolution to happen

- Original verb must be separable or dropped
    - Verb chaining may help with this
- Another relativizing strategy must arise for non-copula constructions
- Original relativizer becomes copula verb, taking verb inflections
    - Can new copula also be dropped or replaced with pro-verb?

## Plural Pronouns

- Plural pronouns can be formed by combining singular pronouns
    - I.You -> We (incl.), I.He -> We (excl.), He.He -> They, You.You -> You (pl.)
