# My First Language

_by armytag_

## Goals

1. **Endgoal:** Complete entire process of creating a language
2. **Vague Phrase:** Intuitive brevity
3. **Naturalism:** Somewhat naturalistic (6/10)
4. **Complexity:** Medium complexity, explore a variety of techniques
5. **Derivation:** Use non-concatenative morphology in a few places
6. **Phonological Features:** 
    - something
7. **Grammar Features:**
    - Widespread use of pro-forms, aggressively drop pro-forms when possible
    - Many grammatical voices for valency manipulation
    - Case marking (?)
8. **Culture Features:** 
    - something

## Pro-Dropping

What strategies can be used for pro-dropping?

Using these pseudo-words:

- _gim_ = dog
- _dak_ = cat
- _tum_ = mouse
- _kar_ = chase
- _mul_ = catch
- _la_  = pro-verb
- _-a_  = NOM suffix
- _-i_  = ACC suffix
- _-e_  = 3.SG.S suffix
- _-ok_ = 3.SG.O suffix

_gim-a dak-i kar-e-ok_
"The dog chases the cat."

_gim-a dak-i kar-e-ok mul-e-ok_
"The dog chases the cat. It catches it."

_gim-a dak-i kar-e-ok dak-e tum-i la-e-ok_
"The dog chases the cat. The cat (chases) the mouse."

## Word Order

- SOV
- SO[V-Neg] _Negative suffix after verb_
- Oblique before Verb

## Plural Pronouns

- Plural pronouns can be formed by combining singular pronouns
    - I.You -> We (incl.), I.He -> We (excl.), He.He -> They, You.You -> You (pl.)

## Copula Evolution

***This is an interesting idea, but it may not be a good fit for this language***

Copula can evolve from a relativizing word at the end of relative clauses, for example:

- "John, that student, he studies." -> "John, that student. He studies." -> "John that(COP) student"

This requires certain conditions for the evolution to happen

- Original verb must be separable or dropped
    - Verb chaining may help with this
- Another relativizing strategy must arise for non-copula constructions
- Original relativizer becomes copula verb, taking verb inflections
    - Can new copula also be dropped or replaced with pro-verb?
