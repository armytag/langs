### T78 - Eres

With the rapid expansion of the Uwul people along the *Henkopix* river and increasing trade with the Indrasi, Eres has grown to unparalleled levels of prosperity as the gateway between the two regions.  Along with this boom in wealth and population has come an increase in strife.  The wealthiest families, in an effort to maintain order and protect their mercantile interests, established groups of hired muscle throughout Eres.  They also engaged with each other more directly and more frequently in order to coordinate these groups and resolve misunderstandings.  With a fledgling ruling class backed by dedicated enforcers, Eres has entered a new stage of social organization more fitting of a proper "city".
