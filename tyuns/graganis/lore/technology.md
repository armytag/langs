### Composting

For generations it has been common practice to pile waste in certain locations and cover it with dirt.  It has also been know that these mounds will sometimes give rise to a flourishing of plant growth, suggesting this waste could be useful in agriculture.  Yet only recently have the Uwul determined which kinds of waste are best for turning into rich soil and established common practices to facilitate this process.  The starting mixture usually consists of unused plant materials like leaves, stems, and grasses, along with food waste, animal manure, and unused animal parts.  This is piled into a mound which is covered in dirt and left to develop for half a year to a year.  It is then either transfered to other plots, or planted directly into like a raised bed.  Some communities also include human feces in the compost mixture, but this practice is not yet widespread.

### Traditional Medicinal Texts

As the Uwul expand farther up the *Henkopix* river, they encounter a new environment with noticably different plants and animals compared to the subtropical jungle they had been living in.  This created a desire to document the local flora and fauna with useful medicinal applications in both the old and new territories, to help travels migrating between these two environments.  Although such texts are still inaccesible to most of the still-illiterate population, the acolytes that travel between the holy cities in the south and the new frontiers in the north find these medicinal texts invaluable.
