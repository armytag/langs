### Traditional Medicinal Texts

As the Uwul expand farther up the *Henkopix* river, they encounter a new environment with noticably different plants and animals compared to the subtropical jungle they had been living in.  This created a desire to document the local flora and fauna with useful medicinal applications in both the old and new territories, to help travels migrating between these two environments.  Although such texts are still inaccesible to most of the still-illiterate population, the acolytes that travel between the holy cities in the south and the new frontiers in the north find these texts invaluable.
