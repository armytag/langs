# Rules
- [x] Have more phonemic diphthongs than monophthongs. Convince me that your diphthongs are true diphthongs and not just a monophthong with a glide in the onset or coda.
- [ ] **Bonus**: Have at least one phonemic triphthong, or have a diphthong with a long vowel in it. Convince me that a triphthongal analysis is the best analysis and that the vowel sequence is not just a mono- or diphthong with a glide in the onset or coda.
- [x] Have at least 3 laterals. This is open to some interpretation: you could simply contrast, say, /l̪ɭ ʎ/, or have vocalic segments pattern like laterals, or have lateral release on (some of) your stops, or argue that your bilabial fricatives are lateral because they have central closure, or whatever else you can think of.
- [x] **Bonus**: Contrast at least 4 different coronal places of articulation. 3 of these places of articulation must have at least 2 phonemes representing them.
- [x] Have at least 4 major allophones for at least one of your phonemes. Make sure to note which allophone is phonemic, and make sure to define the conditioning environments for the other 3. You’re welcome to cop-out with a little bit of something like nasal place assimilation, but I encourage you to be a little more creative.
- [x] **Bonus**: Have 4 major allophones for each in a series of consonants. For instance, all your obstruents might have a similar allophony and only differ by place. You’re welcome to be liberal in what you consider an allophone.
- [ ] Have stress assignment rules. I’m not quantifying this one because I just want to see conlangers tackle an aspect of prosody in the first place. You’re welcome to have underlying lexical stress or categorical root/word/phrase-initial/final stress, but at least one phonological process should shift stress in some way from the canonical position.
- [ ] Have roving morphemes. You must have a class of morphemes that encode grammatical information but that can be placed in at least 2 different grammatical slots or morphosyntactic positions. Which slot they fill can mark something else grammatically, but the morphemes themselves should encode the same grammatical information no matter where they’re placed. This can look like inversion, but I encourage you to make it a little weirder than that if you can!
- [ ] **Bonus**: Use reduplication of roving morphemes to mark some kind of pragmatic information. Be creative both with what information is marked and the reduplication patterns.
- [ ] Use a subject medial word order as the unmarked word order: either VSO or OSV.
- [ ] **Bonus**: Describe relative clauses and at least 1 other type of subclause. You’re welcome to keep or change the basic word order, but in any case I want to see what solutions you come up with for marking subclauses.
- [ ] Have at least 3 different kinds of compounds. Or rather, 3 different compounding patterns or structures that are all productive and routinely used to derive new complex words. For instance, noun-noun compounds vs. verb-verb compounds vs. verb-noun compounds, or you could have different patterns of noun incorporation, or whatever else you can think of. You’re also welcome to treat reduplication as a type of compounding, provided that the reduplicant is at least the size of a syllable.
- [ ] **Bonus**: In at least one compounding pattern, treat both stems as separate words for some but not all inflectional morphology. For example, a prefix might attach twice to a compound in front of each stem, but a suffix will attach only once after both stems, or vice versa. Or maybe different harmonic patterns apply to just one or both stems in a compound, or maybe there are multiple reduplication patterns that interact with compounds in different ways. I encourage you to get creative!

# Grammar

## Word Order

- Agent-medial, verb-final (SV, PAV)
    - Agent (ergative) marked by following word derived from "with" or "follow"
    - Postpositions
- RelN or Correlative (woman REL leave 3SG buy clothes → "The woman who left buys clothes")
- Possessed noun marked by prefix
    - Genitive POSS-Noun
