# A Poetic Language

_by Tristan Armitage_

### Goals

- Explore conflation of time and space
- Noun relationships denoted through affixing

### Major Ideas

- Free word order 
- Agglutenative
- No adpositions
    - Adpositions in proto language, evolved into noun cases
    - Other relationships denoted with possessed nouns (e.g. table's above), positional verbs (be-above), and verb affixes
- Null-subject
- Internal-External analogy for Past-Future
    - "inner-week" = last week, "outer-week" = next week
    - What is the present?  Is the some kind of boundary or event horizon?  "boundary-week" = this week?  Does it need a way to specify, or can it go unmarked?  Maybe using the locative case?

### Minor Ideas

- Tense distinction between today and further times (both past and future)
- Active-stative alignment

### Phonology

| VOWELS | Front | Back  |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Close  | i     | u (y) |
| Mid    | e     | o     |
| Open   | a     | ʌ (u) |

| CONSONANTS        | Labial  | Alveolar | Post<br>Alveolar | Velar   |
|-------------------|---------|----------|------------------|---------|
| Nasal             | m       | n        |                  | ŋ       |
| Voiced Plosive    | b       | d        |                  | ɡ       |
| Unvoiced Plosive  | p       | t        |                  | k       |
| Aspirated Plosive | pʰ (ph) | tʰ (th)  |                  | kʰ (kh) |
| Fricative         | f       | s        | ʃ (c)            | x       |
| Lateral Fricative |         | ɬ (l)    |                  |         |
| Affricate         |         | ts       | tʃ (ch)          | kx      |

### Phonotactics

(C)V(K)

- Onset can be any consonant
- Coda can only be nasals or fricatives [m, n, ŋ, f, s, ʃ, x, ɬ]
- Vowels cannot appear alone, they must have either an onset or coda

### Grammar

- Word order:
    - VSO word order
    - Prepositions and demonstratives before nouns, others after
    - Can evolve to have possessives before noun as well

## Linguistic Evolution

- Preposition become prefixes
- Prepositional prefixes evolve into full case system
- Case system expands to dependent clauses as well
- Word order no longer restricted

### Phonotactics

(C)V(K)

- Onset can be any consonant
- Coda can only be nasals or fricatives [m, n, ŋ, f, s, ʃ, x, ɬ]
- Vowels cannot appear alone, they must have either an onset or coda

### Grammar

Inflect nouns and their dependants for the following noun **cases**:

1. Nominative/Agentive (subject)
2. Accusative/Objective (direct object)
3. Genitive (relationship with the noun)
4. Dative/Instrumental (indirect object)
5. Locative (at a location)
6. Comitative (together with the noun)
7. Ablative (away from the noun)
8. Allative (toward the noun)
9. Prolative (by way of the noun)
10. Translative (changing into the noun)

Inflect verbs for the following **tenses**:

- Past before today
- Past earlier today
- Present
- Future later today
- Future after today

**aspects**:

- Perfective
- Habitual
- Continuous
- Terminative
- Inchoative
- Durative (can use verb reduplication) (?)

#### Tense-Aspect Interactions

| Aspect-Tense | D. Past | N. Past | Present | N. Future | D. Future |
|--------------|---------|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Perfective   |         |         |         |           |           |
| Habitual     |         |         |         |           |           |

Simple **possession** _(my dog)_ is denoted with a suffix inflected for person.  Specific **possession** _(John's dog)_ with a genitive inflection of the possessor.

Verbs inflect for **person** of both the agent and the patient, possibly with a fused affix
