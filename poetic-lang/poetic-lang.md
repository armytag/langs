# A Poetic Language

_by Tristan Armitage_

### Goals

- Explore conflation of time and space
    - Internal-External analogy for Past-Future ("inner-week" = last week, "outer-week" = next week)
    - What is the present?  Is the some kind of boundary or event horizon?  "boundary-week" = this week?  Does it need a way to specify, or can it go unmarked?  Maybe using the locative case?
    - Tense distinction between today and further times (both past and future)
- Noun relationships denoted through affixing
- Polypersonal agreement on verbs
- Null-subject
- Distinguishing (highlighting) cooperative actions
    - Cooperative voice?  Commitative case?  Both?

### Evolution Ideas

- Analytic (isolating) structure evolves into agglutinative (with a little bit of fusional)
- Vowel assimilation (umlaut) undergoes vowel loss and evolves into stem change
- Pronouns evolve into verbal agreement suffixes
- Inclusive 1P pronoun affixes to verb and evolves into cooperative voice
    - Inclusive 1P pronoun could be lost and the exclusive becomes the sole 1P pronoun
- Nasal consonants combine with adjacent vowels to form nasalized vowels
- Some vowels drop after fricatives to create syllabic fricatives
- Consider how nominal relationships evolve (adpositions, cases, converbs)
    - Serial positional verbs (e.g. "sit be-on I chair" = "I sit on a chair") evolve into prepositions
    - Possessed nouns (e.g. "table's above" = "above the table") evolve into postpositions
    - Adpositions evolve into nominal case affixes; which adpositions are repeated enough to become non-optional cases?
    - Verbs combine with case marking to create converbs

### Case Evolution

Intransitive directions:
- move up = ascend
- move down = descend
- move forward = advance
- move backward = retreat
- move outward = release
- move inward = withdraw
- move aimlessly = meander

Transitive directions:
- move toward = approach
- move away from = depart
- move into = enter
- move out from = exit
- move through = traverse
- move around = circumnavigate
- stop at = reach
- start from = originate (from)

Transitive relations:
- be (equivalent)
- become
- benefit
- harm

## Proto Language

### Grammar

- Word order:
    - VSO word order
    - Prepositions and demonstratives before nouns, others after
    - Can evolve to have possessives before noun as well

## Linguistic Evolution

- Preposition become prefixes
- Prepositional prefixes evolve into full case system
- Case system expands to dependent clauses as well
- Non-finite verbs interact with case system to create converbs

## Modern Lanɡuaɡe

### Grammar

Inflect nouns and their dependants for the following noun **cases**:

1. Nominative/Agentive (subject)
2. Accusative/Objective (direct object)
3. Genitive (relationship with the noun)
4. Dative/Instrumental (indirect object)
5. Locative (at a location)
6. Comitative (together with the noun)
7. Ablative (away from the noun)
8. Allative (toward the noun)
9. Prolative (by way of the noun)
10. Translative (changing into the noun)

Pronouns marked for clusivity:

- 1.SG
- 2.SG
- 3.SG
- 1.PL.INCL
- 1.PL.EXCL
- 2.PL
- 3.PL

Inflect verbs for the following **tenses**:

- Past before today
- Past earlier today
- Present
- Future later today
- Future after today

**aspects**:

- Perfective
- Habitual
