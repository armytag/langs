# A Poetic Language

_by Tristan Armitage_

## Goals

1. **Endgoal:** Personal everyday language
2. **Vague Phrase:** Intuitive brevity
3. **Naturalism:** Fairly naturalistic (7/10)
4. **Complexity:** Mostly simple, low word count, some specific places of complexity
5. **Derivation:** Majorly transparent, with a few irregularities
6. **Phonological Features:** 
    - Syllabic consonants
7. **Grammar Features:**
    - Pro-form words (pronouns, pro-adjectives, proverbs, etc.)
    - Pro-drop (can be achieved through valency-reducing voices)
    - No adpositions (instead have coverbs and possessed nouns)
8. **Culture Features:** 
    - Distinction between today and further times in both past and future
    - Time passes from the exterior (future), through a doorway/threshold (present), into the interior (past) 
    - Writing system can also flow in an outward way (perhaps as more ritualistic glyphs, with a simpler direction for informal writing)

## Ideas

### ***Syllabic Consonants***

- ~~Semivowels [S] (j, ɥ, ɰ, w)~~ - not possible, would be considered vowels by definition
- Nasals **[S]** (m, ɱ, n, ɳ, ɲ, ŋ, ɴ)
- Rhotics **[S]** (ɹ, ɻ, r, ʀ, ɾ, ɽ)
- Laterals **[S]** (ɬ, ɮ, l, ɭ, ʎ, ʟ) 
- Sibilants (s, z, ʃ, ʒ, ʂ, ʐ, ɕ, ʑ)

Check out Oogami (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyakoan_language#Consonants) for an example of syllabic fricative evolution (http://amritas.com/101023.htm#10192359)

### ***Deixis***

- Protolang has 3-way spatial distinction (this, that, yon)
- Protolang determiners become modernlang subject, direct object, and indirect object markers
    - this -> SUB, that -> D.OBJ, yon -> I.OBJ
- modernlang simplifies to 2-way spatial distinction, but retains 3-way temporal distinction (now, later today, after today)
    - known as hodiernal tense system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodiernal_tense)
    - how do spatial adpositions interact with 3-way distinction?  Is this even a problem?
- Protolang distant proforms become moderlang existential proforms?
    - E.g. "Can yonbody (somebody) help me?"

### ***Coverbs***

Multiple verbs can appear in a sentence (serial verb construction).
The verbs may be inflected in different ways to indicate different relationships, grammatical/lexical moods, and so on.
