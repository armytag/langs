# A Poetic Language

_by Tristan Armitage_

## Goals

1. **Endgoal:** Personal everyday language
2. **Vague Phrase:** Intuitive brevity
3. **Naturalism:** Fairly naturalistic (7/10)
4. **Complexity:** Mostly simple, low word count, some specific places of complexity
5. **Derivation:** Majorly transparent, with a few irregularities
6. **Phonological Features:** 
    - Syllabic consonants
7. **Grammar Features:**
    - Pro-form words (pronouns, pro-adjectives, proverbs, etc.)
    - Pro-drop (can be achieved through valency-reducing voices)
    - No adpositions (instead have coverbs and possessed nouns)
8. **Culture Features:** 
    - Distinction between today and further times in both past and future (hodiernal system)
    - Time passes from the exterior (future), through a doorway/threshold (present), into the interior (past) 
    - Writing system can also flow in an outward way (perhaps as more ritualistic glyphs, with a simpler direction for informal writing)

## Ideas

### ***Coverbs***

- Multiple verbs can appear in a sentence (serial verb construction or auxillary verbs).
- The verbs may be inflected in different ways to indicate different relationships, grammatical/lexical moods, and so on.
- Could restrict all verbs to only impersonal, intrastivite, or transitive (not ditransitive or tritransitive)
    - Serial verb constructions indicate relationship of nouns
        - E.g. "Go-I approach-store buy-apple" == "I'm going to the store to buy apples"
    - Certain overused protolang verbs can grammaticalize to become clitics indicating the relationship of noun phrases

### ***Parts of Speech***

- Consider which parts of speech need to be primitive, and which can be derived
    - Utilize table from ["Parts of Speech"](https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/3933678/56452_zt02036p126.pdf) (Henɡeveld, Rijkhoff, Siewierska 2004)
- Could have some closed classes and/or derivational systems

### ***Deixis***

- Protolang has 3-way spatial distinction (this, that, yon)
- Protolang determiners become modernlang subject, direct object, and indirect object markers
    - this -> SUB, that -> D.OBJ, yon -> I.OBJ
- modernlang simplifies to 2-way spatial distinction, but retains 3-way temporal distinction (now, later today, after today)
    - known as [hodiernal tense system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodiernal_tense)
    - how do spatial adpositions interact with 3-way distinction?  Is this even a problem?
- Protolang distant proforms become moderlang existential proforms?
    - E.g. "Can yonbody (somebody) help me?"

### ***Number System***

- Non-arithmetic situations can use simplified terminology rather than precise measures
    - "several books" vs "five books", "later in the day" vs "7:12 PM"
    - Time can be measured in new units (e.g. seasons ~= 91 days, pomodoro = 15-minute period)
- Arithmetic system would be fun, but an unimportant feature
    - Positional vs Sign-value

### ***Writing System***

- Use logograms for specific common words (e.g. '&') and ɡrammatical particles (e.ɡ. '-ed' tense)

### ***Syllabic Consonants (?)***

- ~~Semivowels **[S]** (j, ɥ, ɰ, w)~~ - not possible, would be considered vowels by definition
- Nasals **[S]** (m, ɱ, n, ɳ, ɲ, ŋ, ɴ)
- Rhotics **[S]** (ɹ, ɻ, r, ʀ, ɾ, ɽ)
- Laterals **[S]** (ɬ, ɮ, l, ɭ, ʎ, ʟ) 
- Sibilants (s, z, ʃ, ʒ, ʂ, ʐ, ɕ, ʑ)
