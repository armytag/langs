# A Poetic Language

_by Tristan Armitage_

### Goals

- Explore conflation of time and space
    - Internal-External analogy for Past-Future ("inner-week" = last week, "outer-week" = next week)
    - What is the present?  Is the some kind of boundary or event horizon?  "boundary-week" = this week?  Does it need a way to specify, or can it go unmarked?  Maybe using the locative case?
    - Tense distinction between today and further times (both past and future)
- Noun relationships denoted through affixing
- Polypersonal agreement on verbs
- Null-subject
- Distinguishing (highlighting) cooperative actions
    - Cooperative voice?  Commitative case?  Both?

### Evolution Ideas

- Analytic (isolating) structure evolves into agglutinative (with a little bit of fusional)
- Animacy distinction (morpholoɡy evolves from different words for animate vs inanimate nouns)
    - e.ɡ. "kiss a child" = "kiss affect-child" vs "kiss a rock" = "kiss touch-rock"
- Vowel assimilation (umlaut) undergoes vowel loss and evolves into stem change
- Pronouns evolve into verbal agreement suffixes
- Inclusive 1P pronoun affixes to verb and evolves into cooperative voice
    - Inclusive 1P pronoun could be lost and the exclusive becomes the sole 1P pronoun
- Nasal consonants combine with adjacent vowels to form nasalized vowels
- Some vowels drop after fricatives to create syllabic fricatives
- Consider how nominal relationships evolve (adpositions, cases, converbs)
    - Serial positional verbs (e.g. "sit be-on I chair" = "I sit on a chair") evolve into prepositions
    - Possessed nouns (e.g. "table's above" = "above the table") evolve into postpositions
    - Adpositions evolve into nominal case affixes; which adpositions are repeated enough to become non-optional cases?
    - Verbs combine with case marking to create converbs
- Associative plurals ("Paul-PL" = "Paul and company") and additive pluarls ("banana-PL" = "bananas") use same marking (?)

### Case Evolution

Intransitive directions:
- move up = ascend
- move down = descend
- move forward = advance
- move backward = retreat
- move outward = release
- move inward = withdraw
- move aimlessly = meander

Transitive directions:
- move toward = approach
- move away from = depart
- move into = enter
- move out from = exit
- move through = traverse
- move around = circumnavigate
- stop at = reach
- start from = originate (from)

Transitive relations:
- be (equivalent)
- become
- benefit
- harm

### Phonological Evolution

- Devoicinɡ nasals, trills, and approximants
    - N > N̥
    - r > r̥
    - l > l̥ > ɬ

## Proto Language

CV(C)
- Must have one consonant in the onset

- possession-NOUN
- ADJ-neg
- POS-possessee possessor

### Grammar

- Word order:
    - VSO word order
    - Prepositions and demonstratives before nouns, others after
    - Can evolve to have possessives before noun as well

## Linguistic Evolution

- Mood words suffix to verbs
- Vmp Vnt Vɳʈ Vŋk > Ṽp Ṽt Ṽʈ Ṽk
- Pronouns suffix to verbs (after mood)
- Prepositions become prefixes
- Prepositional prefixes evolve into full case system
- Case system expands to dependent clauses as well
- Non-finite verbs interact with case system to create converbs
