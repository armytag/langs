# A Poetic Language

_by Tristan Armitage_

### Goals

- Explore conflation of time and space
- Noun relationships denoted through affixing

### Major Ideas

- Free word order 
- Agglutenative
- No adpositions
    - Adpositions in proto language, evolved into noun cases
    - Other relationships denoted with possessed nouns (e.g. table's above), positional verbs (be-above), and verb affixes
- Null-subject

### Minor Ideas

- Tense distinction between today and further times (both past and future)
- Active-stative alignment

### Phonology

| VOWELS | Front | Back  |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Close  | i     | u (y) |
| Mid    | e     | o     |
| Open   | a     | ʌ (u) |

| CONSONANTS        | Labial  | Alveolar | Post<br>Alveolar | Velar   |
|-------------------|---------|----------|------------------|---------|
| Nasal             | m       | n        |                  | ŋ       |
| Voiced Plosive    | b       | d        |                  | ɡ       |
| Unvoiced Plosive  | p       | t        |                  | k       |
| Aspirated Plosive | pʰ (ph) | tʰ (th)  |                  | kʰ (kh) |
| Fricative         | f       | s        | ʃ (c)            | x       |
| Lateral Fricative |         | ɬ (l)    |                  |         |
| Affricate         |         | ts       | tʃ (ch)          | kx      |

### Phonotactics

(C)V(K)

- Onset can be any consonant
- Coda can only be nasals or fricatives [m, n, ŋ, f, s, ʃ, x, ɬ]
- Vowels cannot appear alone, they must have either an onset or coda

### Grammar

- Word order:
    - VSO word order
    - Prepositions and demonstratives before nouns, others after
    - Can evolve to have possessives before noun as well

## Linguistic Evolution

- Preposition become prefixes
- Prepositional prefixes evolve into full case system
- Case system expands to dependent clauses as well
- Word order no longer restricted
