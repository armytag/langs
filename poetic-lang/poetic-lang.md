# A Poetic Language

_by Tristan Armitage_

## Goals

1. **Endgoal:** Personal everyday language
2. **Vague Phrase:** Intuitive brevity
3. **Naturalism:** Fairly naturalistic (7/10)
4. **Complexity:** Mostly simple, low word count, some specific places of complexity
5. **Derivation:** Majorly transparent, with a few irregularities
6. **Phonological Features:** 
    - Syllabic consonants
7. **Grammar Features:**
    - Pro-form words (pronouns, pro-adjectives, proverbs, etc.)
    - Pro-drop (can be achieved through valency-reducing voices)
    - No adpositions (instead have coverbs and possessed nouns)
8. **Culture Features:** 
    - Distinction between today and further times in both past and future
    - Time passes from the exterior (future), through a doorway/threshold (present), into the interior (past) 
    - Writing system can also flow in an outward way (perhaps as more ritualistic glyphs, with a simpler direction for informal writing)

### Co(n)verbs

Multiple verbs can appear in a sentence (serial verb construction).
The verbs may be inflected in different ways to indicate different relationships, grammatical/lexical moods, and so on.
