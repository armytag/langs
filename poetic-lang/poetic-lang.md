# A Poetic Language

_by armytag_

## Goals

1. **Endgoal:** Personal everyday language
2. **Vague Phrase:** Intuitive brevity
3. **Naturalism:** Fairly naturalistic (7/10)
4. **Complexity:** Mostly simple, low word count, some specific places of complexity
5. **Derivation:** Majorly transparent, with a few irregularities
6. **Phonological Features:** 
    - No voicing distinction for consonants
7. **Grammar Features:**
    - Extensive use of pro-form words, which are dropped as much as possible
    - Apophony to keep word sizes small
8. **Culture Features:** 
    - Distinction between today and further times in both past and future (hodiernal system)
    - Time passes from the exterior (future), through a doorway/threshold (present), into the interior (past) 

## Ideas

### ***Conception of Time***

Time blows like a wind in the following way:

    - first it moves toward the referant (future)
    - then it reaches the referant (present)
    - finally it continues onward having affected the referant (past)

This notion involves motion toward or away from the referant, i.e. it is time that is moving rather than the referant.
This is different from English, where people move forward through time.
Instead, it is time that moves through the person, without regard to that person's spatial orientation.
For example, whereas an English speaker might say "We just have to get through the day", a Poetic speaker would say "We just have to endure the day (as it passes)"

This concept of time also makes time an agent of change which always leaves an effect in the referant, no matter how small.
Another way to think of this could be things which have not affected the referant, things which are currently affecting them, and things which have already affected them.

    * These distinctions seem both temporal and aspectual, and would be worth further investigation.

This can also be thought of like a breath: first with an inhale, then a moment of full breath, and finally with an exhale.
There could be interesting semantic conflations when this concept gets linked with meditative breathing exercises.

### ***Apophony***

- Nasals can raise preceding vowels (e.g. e > i, o > u)

### ***Coverbs***

- Multiple verbs can appear in a sentence (serial verb construction or auxillary verbs).
- The verbs may be inflected in different ways to indicate different relationships, grammatical/lexical moods, and so on.
- Could restrict all verbs to only impersonal, intrastivite, or transitive (not ditransitive or tritransitive)
    - Serial verb constructions indicate relationship of nouns
        - E.g. "Go-I approach-store buy-apple" == "I'm going to the store to buy apples"
    - Certain overused protolang verbs can grammaticalize to become clitics indicating the relationship of noun phrases

### ***Parts of Speech***

- Consider which parts of speech need to be primitive, and which can be derived
    - Utilize table from ["Parts of Speech"](https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/3933678/56452_zt02036p126.pdf) (Henɡeveld, Rijkhoff, Siewierska 2004)
- Could have some closed classes and/or derivational systems

### ***Deixis***

- Protolang has 3-way spatial distinction (this, that, yon)
- Protolang determiners become modernlang subject, direct object, and indirect object markers
    - this -> SUB, that -> D.OBJ, yon -> I.OBJ
- modernlang simplifies to 2-way spatial distinction, but retains 3-way temporal distinction (now, later today, after today)
    - known as [hodiernal tense system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodiernal_tense)
    - how do spatial adpositions interact with 3-way distinction?  Is this even a problem?
- Protolang distant proforms become moderlang existential proforms?
    - E.g. "Can yonbody (somebody) help me?"

### ***Number System***

- Non-arithmetic situations can use simplified terminology rather than precise measures
    - "several books" vs "five books", "later in the day" vs "7:12 PM"
    - Time can be measured in new units (e.g. seasons ~= 91 days, pomodoro = 15-minute period)
- Arithmetic system would be fun, but an unimportant feature
    - Positional vs Sign-value

### ***Writing System***

- Use logograms for specific common words (e.g. '&') and ɡrammatical particles (e.ɡ. '-ed' tense)

### ***Syllabic Consonants (?)***

- ~~Semivowels **[S]** (j, ɥ, ɰ, w)~~ - not possible, would be considered vowels by definition
- Nasals **[S]** (m, ɱ, n, ɳ, ɲ, ŋ, ɴ)
- Rhotics **[S]** (ɹ, ɻ, r, ʀ, ɾ, ɽ)
- Laterals **[S]** (ɬ, ɮ, l, ɭ, ʎ, ʟ) 
- Sibilants (s, z, ʃ, ʒ, ʂ, ʐ, ɕ, ʑ)
