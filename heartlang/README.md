## Goal:

Create a language that is personal to my tastes, that is pleasant and intuitive for me to use.

## Intended Audience and Media:

I myself will be the primary audience, but I also intend to share with strangers on the internet.  I will document the language for myself in a more technical style, but I will share pieces showing off the language with minimal formal description (aside from phonetic transcription).  I also intend to write poetry and lyrics in this language, so the grammar and phonaesthetics should enable that.

## Conworld

Speaker is myself in the everyday environment I find myself in, both now and in my past.  One major "cultural" theme will be impermanent residence and regular change of living location/condition.

The speaker is a human, taller than average, with lots of hair on the head, face, and body.  The language reflects that the size of the speaker has increased from the past to the present.  Aside from walking and running, they have travelled via many kinds of artificial transport.  They are synesthetic, and this affects the color terminology as well as conflation of final 4 and 6 in numbers greater than 20 (or 100?).

## Phonology Ideas

1. Reduplication like Newar (and Thai?)
1. Some initial mutations: vowels (Sinhala), consonants (Newar), or both

Inspiration:
- mtʃarabi
- bɯŋ bon

Sounds from inspiration:
- syllabic nasals

## Phonology

## Lexicon Ideas

- Bijective base-ten numeral system (..., 8, 9, A, 11, 12, ..., 18, 19, 1A, 21, 22, ...)
