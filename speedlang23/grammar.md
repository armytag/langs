## Morphology

### Nouns

Nouns have direct and oblique cases.  In regular (nominative) clauses, the direct case is used for intransitive subject and transitive agent, and the oblique case is used for transitive object.  In (ergative) subclauses, the direct case is used for the transitive object, and the oblique case is used for intransitive subject and transitive object.  In both kinds of clauses, the direct case is used for predicative nouns (the "object" of copular sentences), and the oblique case is used in possessive/genitive phrases and adpositional phrases.

: Pronouns

Clitic forms attach to the first word in the clause.  Since subclauses always start with an adverb, the clitic will attach to that adverb.

### Verbs

Present tense verbs a fairly synthetic and mark aspect, mood, and noun agreement via affixes.  However, each verb has a single past tense form and is accompanied by a specific auxiliary verb which takes all of the typical marking.

#### Present Tense

Verbs take prefixes to indicate aspect.

When a subject is dropped and conveyed only from verbal agreement, the verb is called an ***integrated verb***.

When no other words precede a transitive integrated verb within a clause, the oblique clitic will attach to the verb and create a ***composite verb*** which marks both agent and patient.  These composite verbs can form entire clauses on their own.

#### Past Tense

## Syntax

### Adjectives

Adjectives may precede the noun they modify with no additional agreement.  However, it is far more common for adjectives to occur after the relative particle *si* that follows the noun being modified.

### Possession

The typical way to express possession is to place the possessor in oblique form after the relative particle *si* which follows the possessed noun.  For a small set of possessed nouns, namely kinship terms and certain relational nouns, possession is instead marked by reduplicating the first syllable of the possessor and placing it before the possessed noun.
