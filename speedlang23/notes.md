## Morphosyntax

- Split-ergative based on tense/aspect
    - Some interaction with passives or other valency changing?
- Suppletion in a particle separate from verb (e.g. tense)
- Possession: owning vs holding, distinguished by whether you carry it with your body ("portability"?)
    - my son > son-POSS 1SG
    - my house > house-POSS 1SG
    - my book > 1SG.GEN book

## Prompt

### Phonology constraints

1. Use two points of articulation you don't use very often - (free choice! anything out of your comfort zone - willing to consider any secondary articulation that patterns as a POA as a separate POA if it makes sense)
1. Alternative! use some vowel feature you don't use often (phonation, backness, protrusion, etc etc)
1. Have at least three phonemes which exhibit some kind of gradation (e.g. this means they merge with other phonemes in certain morphological settings, or create new phones in some morphophonological environment)
1. Have a closed set of roots which break phonotactic tendencies (e.g. from direct loans from another language or lost substrate etc.) - provide examples of how they differ from regular roots

### Morphosyntactic constraints

1. Display some kind of split morphosyntactic alignment (e.g. active-stative, DOM, etc.) 
1. Have radically different marking for subclauses (up to you whether it's inversion of marking, if this is the split ergativity, or some word order inversions, or something of the like) 
1. Have a number of verbal classifiers, and have various lexeme have a different meaning entirely depending on verbal classifier (what exactly “classifier” means here is up to you) - show at least 3 examples
1. Have a class of roots which can change word class through zero derivation (with at least 3 examples)
1. Come up with a label: whether describing an unusual combination of functions for a morpheme, or a specific case which doesn't have an assigned name, or a phenomenon that requires ad hoc terminology - what this feature is and where it appears is up to you 
1. Have some kind of possessive classifier system (e.g. alienability, edibility) 
    1. Bonus! have them marked differently, in terms of agreement, location of morphemes, or otherwise
1. Have some morphological category marked on a closed set of words by suppletion. (bonus points if the morpheme in question wouldn't otherwise be adjacent to the root)

### Sentence/phrase level constraints

1. As per usual, 5 sentences from 5moyd or Conlangers Syntax Test Cases (or make your own as you wish of a similar complexity)
1. Finally, write some description of the sea! (leaving this broad, so either “it's big and wet” or a poem or a scientific definition or whatever! surprise me!) - if your people don't live by the sea tell me about how they might describe it if they saw it (big lake? like the sky but wet? liquid substance with stuff in it?) 
1. As a bonus; show me a sea or water related conceptual metaphor
