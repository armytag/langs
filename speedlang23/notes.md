# Splang23 Notes

## Morphosyntactic Marking

- ***Tense*** - auxiliary verb periphrasis (clause final)
- ***Aspect/Mood*** - verbal prefix
- ***Person Agreement*** - verbal suffix
- ***Core Arguments*** - DEF:NUM suffix (clitic for pronouns)
- ***Peripheral Arguments*** - adpositions
- ***Subordinate Clause*** - adverb + ergative alignment
- ***Possession*** - relative particle or reduplication
- ***Adjectives*** - precede, or follow after relative particle

## Phonology

### Two Under-used Places of Articulation

Sibilant vs Palatal, and Labialized Velar.

|                | Labial | Plain Alv. | Sibilant Alv. | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
| :---           | :---:  | :---:      | :---:         | :---:   | :---: | :---:   |
| Ejective Stop  | p      | t          | ts            | tʃ      | kʷ    | ʔ       |
| Fricative      |        |            | s             | ʃ       | xʷ    | h       |
| Plain Sonorant | m      | n          | l             | j       | w     |         |
: Consonants

### One Under-used Vowel Feature

Nasalization.

|       | Front | Center | Back  |
| ---   | :---: | :---:  | :---: |
| Close | i ĩ   |        | u ũ   |
| Mid   | e     |        | o     |
| Open  |       | a ã    |       |
: Vowels

### Phonemes with Gradation (3+)

Fricatives to stops in onset of closed syllable.

### Closed Set of Roots that Break Phonological Tendencies

Coda /m/ in loan words (mainly related to sailing).

## Morphosyntax

### Split Alignment

Present-tense nominative, past-tense ergative.

### Subclause Marking

Ergative alignment rather than nominative.

### Verbal Classifiers

Every verb takes one of ten auxiliaries, with the choice being lexical. 

- 'go run'
- 'go say'
- 'get hear'

### Roots with Zero Derivation

Adjectives (maybe only some) into nouns.

### Custom label/terminology

"Composite verb" for a verb with both subject suffix and object clitic, where neither subject or object appear as independant words.

### Possessive Classifiers

> "Kin terms often figure in the specified class, and usually several to many of the language's kin terms and a few other nouns take the non-default possessive form while all others, including a few kin terms, take the default possessive form. In addition, body parts, meronyms (parts in part-whole relationships), topological nouns, and property nouns often figure in non-default possessive classes."  - WALS Chapter 59

There will be a closed set with special marking, and an open set with default marking.  These sets have some semantic basis, but are ultimately *lexical*; the possession paradigm depends solely on the word being possessed.

Special marking (reduplication) for:
- Kinship
- Part-whole relationships
- Topological nouns (relation to other constituents, e.g. "opposite", "neighbor")
- Some exceptional words based on phonological analogy (they sound like another set)

Default marking (genitive particle) for:
- A few kinship terms
- Body parts
- All other nouns

### Suppletion of Morphological Category in Closed Set

## Texts

### Sentences

### Sea Story

### Conceptual Metaphor

- The ocean brings fortune (good and bad)
    - Risk and opportunity lie at sea, security and stagnation reside inland

## Prompt

### Phonology constraints

- [x] Use two points of articulation you don't use very often - (free choice! anything out of your comfort zone - willing to consider any secondary articulation that patterns as a POA as a separate POA if it makes sense)
- [x] Alternative! use some vowel feature you don't use often (phonation, backness, protrusion, etc etc)
- [x] Have at least three phonemes which exhibit some kind of gradation (e.g. this means they merge with other phonemes in certain morphological settings, or create new phones in some morphophonological environment)
- [x] Have a closed set of roots which break phonotactic tendencies (e.g. from direct loans from another language or lost substrate etc.) - provide examples of how they differ from regular roots

### Morphosyntactic constraints

- [x] Display some kind of split morphosyntactic alignment (e.g. active-stative, DOM, etc.) 
- [x] Have radically different marking for subclauses (up to you whether it's inversion of marking, if this is the split ergativity, or some word order inversions, or something of the like) 
- [x] Have a number of verbal classifiers, and have various lexeme have a different meaning entirely depending on verbal classifier (what exactly “classifier” means here is up to you) - show at least 3 examples
- [x] Have a class of roots which can change word class through zero derivation (with at least 3 examples)
- [x] Come up with a label: whether describing an unusual combination of functions for a morpheme, or a specific case which doesn't have an assigned name, or a phenomenon that requires ad hoc terminology - what this feature is and where it appears is up to you 
- [x] Have some kind of possessive classifier system (e.g. alienability, edibility) (Bonus! have them marked differently, in terms of agreement, location of morphemes, or otherwise)
- [ ] Have some morphological category marked on a closed set of words by suppletion. (bonus points if the morpheme in question wouldn't otherwise be adjacent to the root)

### Sentence/phrase level constraints

- [ ] As per usual, 5 sentences from 5moyd or Conlangers Syntax Test Cases (or make your own as you wish of a similar complexity)
- [ ] Finally, write some description of the sea! (leaving this broad, so either “it's big and wet” or a poem or a scientific definition or whatever! surprise me!) - if your people don't live by the sea tell me about how they might describe it if they saw it (big lake? like the sky but wet? liquid substance with stuff in it?) 
- [ ] As a bonus; show me a sea or water related conceptual metaphor
