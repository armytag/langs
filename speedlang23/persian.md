## Summary

- Synthetic nominative present vs. analytic ergative past

## Verbs

- Two stems: present and past tense
    - Most synthetic forms use present tense, but inifinitive built from past
    - Past forms generally end in *-t* or *-d*, but there is usually also some other kind of change as well
- Present tense copula *h-*, past copula *b(aw)-*
- Person-mood suffixes added to present stems for present tense
- Four moods
    - Indicative
    - Imperative
    - Subjunctive (present wish, past hypothetical)
    - Optative (often done with particles instead)
- Past tense uses periphrastic constructions with the verb in past participle form, with an auxiliary verb inflected
    - Preterite formed with copula *h-*
        - raft h-eːm ("I went")
    - Past preterite formed with past copula *b(uːd)*
        - raft buːd h-eːm ("I had gone")
    - Perfect formed with *eːst-* "to stand" (result of action is still observable in the present)
        - raft eːst-eːm ("I have/am gone")
    - Past perfect formed with *eːstaːd* (result of action was still observable in the past)
        - raft eːstaːd h-eːm ("I had/was gone")
- Nominative alignment in present, Ergative alignment in past
    - toː mardaːn weːn-eː ("You saw the men")
    - toː mardaːn diːd h-eːnd ("By you the men were seen")
- Present tense of buːdan is baweːm, which can be used with past participle to convey present passive
    - daːd baw-eːd ("It is given")
- Particles convey aspect (aside from perfectives given above)
