## Notes
- Noun incorporation
    - Common, less-animate nouns are more likely to be incorporated than niche or animate nouns
        - Body poarts are especially common
    - General verbs which take much of their meaning from their arguments are more likely to incorporate some of those arguments
        - "to be good" and "to have" incorporate especially often
    - Verbs which affect the patient are more likely to incorporate that patient
        - "to make" or "to eat" are more likely than "to look at" or "to hear"
    - Type 1: Lexical Compounding
        - Creates an intransitive verb with a narrower scope by incorporating a noun, which generalizes and loses its individual semantic and syntactic characteristic.
        - Generally used in contexts without specific, individuated patients
    - Type 2: Manipulation of Case
        - Affects structure of clause by moving an instrument, location, or possessor to direct object (or even subject) role.
        - Doesn't necessarily mean that the incorporated object is not specific.
    - Type 3: Manipulation of Discourse Structure
        - Used to background established referents
        - Usually happens in polysynthetic languages where verbs already encode a lot of information
- Verbal mood and aspect (3+ morphemes)
    - Indicative (perfective): -a
    - Imperfective: -i
    - Imperative: -o
    - Prohibitive: -oqʼa
    - Optative: -opi
    - Subordinate: -akʼa
- Mark direct object (not subject)
    - Agrees in person, number, and class

# Modifiers

- Modifiers can apply to verbs (as adverbs) or nouns (as adjectives)
- Adjectives are modifiers that agree with a noun in class
    - Agreement is consonant of singular/plural noun class marker, with vowel /o/
- Adjectives come right after the noun they modify

| CLASS | Single | Plural |
|---    |---     |---     |
| G1    | -bo    | -ɓo    |
| G2    | -ko    | -ɓo    |
| G3    | -kʼo   | -lo    |
| G4    | -qo    | -ɡo    |

# Numbers

# Syntax
- Verb initial
- Nouns order by higher animacy before lower animacy, and 2P before 1P before 3P
- Prepositions
- Nouns before relative clause ("the boy *that* lived")
- Adjective after noun
- Demonstrative after noun
- Closed class of preverbal adverbs (mostly grammartical)
    - Negation word (clause initial)
    - Habitual/repeated aspect
    - Phasal polarity
- Other adverbs (e.g. manner) occur immediately after verb
- Symmetric and assymetric negation depending on some other factor (e.g. tense)
- *Have at least three ways of forming requests/commands, and describe how they differ in use (i.e. which contexts)*
    1. Imperative verb (strong/direct)
    1. Optative verb with desired situation (soft/indirect) ("Hope I have water" rather than "Hope you give me some water")
    1. Negative prohibitive verb (joking/intimate)
- *Include at least two ways negative commands can be formed*
    1. Prohibitive verb (suggestion)
    1. Negative imperative verb (command)

## Comparatives
- Formed with verb meaning 'exceed' which takes the measure of comparison as an modifier adverb
    - exceed-PFV-G3.SG big G1.1SG-NOM-PRS dog-G3.SG-ACC
    - "I am bigger than a dog"

## Subordinate Temporal Clauses
- Subordinate clause taking time slot in matrix sentence (preceding matrix verb)
- Subordinate clause is verb-final
- Subordinate subject takes special relative-tense marking
- Subordinate verb takes subordinate aspect/mood marking

# Phasal Polarity

- Distinguish neutral and counterexpectational "still"
- Interconnection between aspect and phasal polarity

### *ALREADY*
- Neutral in perfective with no additional marking
- Counterfactual with periphrastic or coverb construction

### *STILL*
- Neutral imperfective or stative/locative predicate with no additional marking
- Can be highlighted by periphrastic construction with temporal adverb or "continue" verb

### *NO LONGER*
- Negated verb with locative/stative predicate and *STILL* adverb
- Imperfective or perfective coverb

### *YET*
- Counterfactual using adverb

### *NOT YET*
- Negated verb with *YET* adverb

## Fula PhP

- *STILL* has a continuative meaning, and *ALREADY* has an inchoative meaning, both overlap with aspectual functions.
    - This is similar to the dichotomy between imperfective (situational instance) and perfective (event boundaries)
- Neutral *ALREADY* conveyed by plain *perfective* aspect without extra marking
- Counterfactual *ALREADY* conveyed by either periphrastic adverbial construction (e.g. "quick like that") or temporal verbs (e.g. "take a long time")
    - Sometimes also uses second verb meaning "be finished" in perfective form
- For non-verbal predicates denoting states (mainly locatives and existentials), *STILL* is left unmarked
- *STILL* can be conveyed periphrasticly with phasal verbs (e.g. "continue") or adverbials (e.g. "until now", "even today")
- A clause-final phasal polarity item *tawon* can be used to indicate counterfactual *STILL*
    - E.g. "He wants to go to school, but he is still (too) small."
- In non-perfective contexts, *NOT YET* can be conveyed by the auxiliary "to have not yet V-ed" appears between subject and infinitive verb.
- In aspectually-marked contexts, the clause-final adverb *tawon* can be used for *NOT YET*
    - *Tawon* can be used with both perfective and imperfective verbs
- *Tawon* functions as either *STILL* or *NOT YET* depending on the negation of the verb (an internal negation)
- *NO LONGER* constructions conveyed by clause-final adverb *fahin* "again", or by a negated auxiliaries *meet-* "to do something once before" or *acc-* "to leave" plus an infinitive verb

### Summary
- *ALREADY*
    - neutral -- perfective verb
    - counterfactual -- perfective verb + *timmi* (coverb)
- *STILL*
    - various (*tawon* (adverb))
- *NOT YET*
    - perfective/imperfective -- *tawon* (adverb)
    - imperfective -- *siwa* (negated auxiliary)
- *NO LONGER*
    - perfective + dynamic -- *acc-* (auxiliary)
    - imperfective + dynamic -- *meet-* (auxiliary)
    - non-dynamic -- *fahin* (adverb)
