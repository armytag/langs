### Aesop's Fables

#### The Plane Tree

<div class="side-by-side">
<p>Two Travellers, walking in the noonday sun, sought the shade of a widespreading tree to rest. As they lay looking up among the pleasant leaves, they saw that it was a Plane Tree.</p>
<p></p>
</div>

<div class="side-by-side">
<p>"How useless is the Plane!" said one of them. "It bears no fruit whatever, and only serves to litter the ground with leaves."</p>
<p></p>
</div>

<div class="side-by-side">
<p>"Ungrateful creatures!" said a voice from the Plane Tree. "You lie here in my cooling shade, and yet you say I am useless! Thus ungratefully, O Jupiter, do men receive their blessings!"</p>
<p></p>
</div>

#### The Stag & His Reflection

<div class="side-by-side">
<p>A Stag, drinking from a crystal spring, saw himself mirrored in the clear water. He greatly admired the graceful arch of his antlers, but he was very much ashamed of his spindling legs.</p>
<p></p>
</div>

<div class="side-by-side">
<p>"How can it be," he sighed, "that I should be cursed with such legs when I have so magnificent a crown."</p>
<p></p>
</div>

<div class="side-by-side">
<p>At that moment he scented a panther and in an instant was bounding away through the forest. But as he ran his wide-spreading antlers caught in the branches of the trees, and soon the Panther overtook him. Then the Stag perceived that the legs of which he was so ashamed would have saved him had it not been for the useless ornaments on his head.</p>
<p></p>

#### The Fisherman & the Little Fish

<p>A poor Fisherman, who lived on the fish he caught, had bad luck one day and caught nothing but a very small fry. The Fisherman was about to put it in his basket when the little Fish said:</p>
<p></p>
</div>

<div class="side-by-side">
<p>"Please spare me, Mr. Fisherman! I am so small it is not worth while to carry me home. When I am bigger, I shall make you a much better meal."</p>
<p></p>
</div>

<div class="side-by-side">
<p>But the Fisherman quickly put the fish into his basket.</p>
<p></p>
</div>

<div class="side-by-side">

<p></p>
</div>
