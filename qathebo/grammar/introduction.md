# Introduction

Qʼathebʼo is a constructed language (conlang) which I started making in late 2024.  All of my prior attempts at creating a conlang had fizzled out in the early stages, or turned into massive projects that never got past the research phase.  I resolved to develop a conlang enough to do nontrivial translations and participate in community activities like Lexember.  To keep myself from overthinking every choice and dragging the process out, I decided to start this language with several constraints in place.

I ultimately chose these constraints from three Speedlang prompts taken from the [conlang subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/).  Speedlangs are designed to foster rapid ideation and experimentation by placing several creative constraints and requiring a quick turnaround for submissions, typically two to three weeks.  With Qʼathebʼo I was able to follow a similar process and managed to get the core of the language finished in less than three weeks, though I've expanded it a lot since then.  You can find the details of the three prompts in the [Speedlang Prompts](#speedlang-prompts) section.

Typologically, Qʼathebʼo is an agglutinating verb-initial language with an animacy hierarchy, nominal tense, and noun incorporation.  There is some minor vowel assimilation, as well as a robust derivation system.  All of these charaterstics and more will be explained in the subsequent sections, and by the end of this document you should have a complete grasp of the workings of the Qʼathebʼo language.
