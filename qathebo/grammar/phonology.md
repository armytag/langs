# Phonology

## Vowels

There are three phonemic vowel qualities in Qʼathebʼo: /a/, /i/, and /o/.  There is a fourth vowel \[ɛ\] which is prevelant in Qʼathebʼo but does not appear to be phonemic; rather it appears exclusively as the result of a highly-regular [vowel assimilation process](#vowel-assimilation).

|---        |:---:  |:---: |
| Close     | i     |      |
| Close-Mid |       | o    |
| Open-Mid  | (ɛ)   |      |
| Open      |       | a    |

Vowels are never differentiated based on length, nasality, or any other characteristics.

## Consonants

There are 18 consonantal phonemes in Qʼathebʼo.  Stops are distinguished between four articulation modes: voiceless, voiced, ejective, and implosive.  There are also two nasal, two fricative, and one approximant consonants.

| Voiced Plosives    | b      | d        | g     |        |

## Phonotactics

Syllables in Qʼathebʼo always contain a consonant followed by a vowel in a strict CV structure.  Stress occurs on the penultimate syllable of a word, which manifests as a relatively louder and slightly higher-pitched pronunciation of the syllable.

### Vowel Assimilation

Vowels undergo a pervasive, regular assimilation process based on the following vowel.  The low vowel /a/ becomes \[ɛ\] when the following syllable contains /i/, and /i/ likewise assimilates to \[ɛ\] before a syllable with /a/.  The rounded vowel /o/ instead undergoes a dissimilation process with following /o/ syllables, also becoming \[ɛ\].  These patterns can be see in the following examples.

<dl class="comparison col4">
<dt>[ɗoθ<em>a</em>-ɗa]</dt> <dd>"rose"</dd>
<dt>[ɗoθ<em>ɛ</em>-ki]</dt> <dd>"(several) roses"</dd>
<dt>[kob<em>i</em>-mi]</dt> <dd>"dogs"</dd>
<dt>[kob<em>ɛ</em>-ma]</dt> <dd>"dog"</dd>
<dt>[pʼaq<em>o</em>-la]</dt> <dd>"hills"</dd>
<dt>[pʼaq<em>ɛ</em>-qo]</dt> <dd>"hill"</dd>
</dl>

The /o/ dissimilation occurs for any number of /o/ syllables in a row.

<dl class="comparison col4">
<dt>[ɗɛθɛ-q<em>o</em>]</dt> <dd>"a home"</dd>
<dt>[ɗɛθɛ-q<em>ɛ</em>-to]</dt> <dd>"at home (<abbr>LOC</abbr>)"</dd>
</dl>

It's important to note that when /i/ assimilates to \[ɛ\], it no longer triggers assimilation for a preceding /a/.

<dl class="comparison col4">
<dt>[k<em>ɛ</em>ɓ<em>i</em>-ki]</dt> <dd>"(several) berries"</dd>
<dt>[k<em>a</em>ɓ<em>ɛ</em>-ɗa]</dt> <dd>"berry"</dd>
</dl>

## Orthography

Qʼathebʼo is primarily written using the [Adlam script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adlam_script), originally developed for transcribing the [Fula language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fula_language).  The Adlam script is an alphabet with dedicated characters for consonants and vowels, and also includes separate capital and lowercase forms of each character. There are also several diacritics used to indicate long vowels, geminated consonants, or sounds from other languages.  It is written from right to left, top to bottom, and the letters are typically combined in a cursive style similar to the Arabic script.

The Adlam script is well suited to the phonology of Qʼathebʼo, with only three noteworthy differences: 

1. /θ/ is written with the <𞤬> character that normally denotes the /f/ sound
1. /ɬ/ is written with the <𞤸> character that normally denotes the /h/ sound.
1. Ejectives are written using the corresponding voiceless plosives combined with the <◌𞥇 > diacritic, which normally denotes a glottal stop ([Arabic hamza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamza)) between the consonant and the following vowel.  Thus <𞤨> /p/ → <𞤨𞥇> /pʼ/.

Qʼathebʼo can also be transcribed in a Latin orthography.  Below is a table showing all of the Adlam characters (both upper and lower case) used in Qʼathebʼo, along with the phonemes they represent and their Latin orthography equivalents.
