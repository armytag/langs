# Phonology

## Vowels

There are four distinct vowel qualities in Qʼathebʼo: /a/, /ɛ/, /i/, and /o/.  Vowels are never differentiated based on length, nasality, or any other characteristics, so it can be said that these four vowel qualities comprise the four phonemic vowels of Qʼathebʼo.

|           | Front | Back |
|---        |:---:  |:---: |
| Close     | i     |      |
| Close-Mid |       | o    |
| Open-Mid  | ɛ     |      |
| Open      |       | a    |

However the phonemic status of /ɛ/ is highly suspect, as it only seems to occur as the result of the highly-regular [vowel assimilation process](#vowel-assimilation).  Nonetheless, this grammar will treat /ɛ/ as a phonemic vowel to better reflect the surface realization of utterances in Qʼathebʼo.

## Orthography

Qʼathebʼo is primarily written using the [Adlam script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adlam_script), originally developed for transcribing the [Fula language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fula_language).  The Adlam script is an alphabet with dedicated characters for consonants and vowels, and also includes separate capital and lowercase forms of each character. There are also several diacritics used to indicate long vowels, geminated consonants, or sounds from other languages.  It is written from right to left, top to bottom, and the letters are typically combined in a cursive style similar to the Arabic script.

The Adlam script is well suited to the phonology of Qʼathebʼo, with only three noteworthy differences: 

1. /θ/ is written with the <𞤬> character that normally denotes the /f/ sound
1. /ɬ/ is written with the <𞤸> character that normally denotes the /h/ sound.
1. Ejectives are written using the corresponding voiceless plosives combined with the <◌𞥇 > diacritic, which normally denotes a glottal stop ([Arabic hamza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamza)) between the consonant and the following vowel.  Thus <𞤨> /p/ → <𞤨𞥇> /pʼ/.

Qʼathebʼo can also be transcribed in a Latin orthography.  The Latin orthography is used throughout this document for the convenience of the reader, although it is often paired with the corresponding Adlam orthography within examples.
