# Derivational Morphology

Derivation is a morphological process of turning one lexical item into another.  It differs from compounding in that the morphology involves affixing a bound morpheme rather than another free word/root ("mis-giving" vs "thanks-giving").  It also differs from the non-derivational morphological processes described in the previous chapter in that it produces new lexical items with no new grammatical information, rather than the same lexical item with new grammatical information ("hunt-er" vs "hunt-ing").
