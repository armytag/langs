# Morphology

## Nouns

The prototypical noun structure is a lexical root, a person-number affix based on animacy group, a case affix, and if appropriate a tense affix (usually on nominal-case nouns).  This is represented by the following template, where <λ> represents the lexical root.

<div class="comparison">
<p>λ-<abbr>P.NUM-CASE(-TENSE)</abbr></p>
</div>

### Animacy Groups (Class/Gender)

There a six classes of nouns that determine the noun's declension pattern.  Specifically, a noun's class affects person-number marking, modifier agreement, and word order.

***Group 1*** -- Adult humans, including human body parts and groups of humans (e.g. society).

***Group 2*** -- Animate, self-moving things such as animals, waterfalls, fire, and animal body parts.

***Group 3*** -- Manipulatable objects such as cooked food, tools, small stones, and crops.

***Group 4*** -- Larger environmental objects such as trees, buildings, and clouds.

***Group 5*** -- Abstract, formless things such as thoughts, ideas, and time.

### Person & Number

Nouns always mark number and person, though lower-animacy groups can only mark third person.

### Case

There are nine nominal cases: nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, instrumental, locative, allative, ablative, and essive.  Unlike most nominative-accusative langauges, Qʼathebʼo is a marked-nominative language, which means the nominative case takes overt marking while the accusative does not.

### Tense

In Qʼathebʼo sentences, clause-level tense is marked on nominative nouns rather than on verbs.  All nouns in the nominative case will mark the same clause-level tense.

#### Simple Tense

Simple clauses make four tense distinctions: present, future, past, and remote past.

**Present** tense is used for events happening at roughly the same time as the moment of speech.  There is some amount of leeway around the actual moment of speech, as events that have just happened or events that are about to happen are typically rendered in the present tense, as seen in %{+2}% and %{+3}% below.  Sometimes the present tense form will even be used for events at indeterminate or underspecified times, as seen in %{+4}% and %{+5}%  Because of this, it may be appropriate to consider the present tense as a kind of default tense.

<div class="gloss">
<p class="number"></p>
<div class="interlinear">
<dl> <dt>aa</dt> <dd>be.careful<abbr>-IMP</abbr></dd> </dl>
</div>
<p class="freetranslation">"Be careful!"</p>
</div>

<div class="gloss">

</div>

<div class="gloss">

<div class="interlinear">

<p class="freetranslation">"Be careful!"</p>
</div>

<div class="gloss">
<p class="number"></p>
<div class="interlinear">
<dl> <dt>aa</dt> <dd>be.careful<abbr>-IMP</abbr></dd> </dl>
</div>
<p class="freetranslation">"Be careful!"</p>
</div>

<div class="gloss">
<p class="number"></p>
<div class="interlinear">
<dl> <dt>aa</dt> <dd>be.careful<abbr>-IMP</abbr></dd> </dl>
</div>
<p class="freetranslation">"Be careful!"</p>
</div>

**Future** tense is used for events that are expected to happen sometime after the moment of speech.

**Past** tense is used to mark events prior to the moment of speech, but recent enough to have some relevance or bearing on the moment of speech.

**Remote-past** tense is used to mark events prior to the moment of speech, but long enough before that they are not overly significant to the moment of speech but rather background or contextual events.

#### Relative Tense

Within dependant clauses the past and remote-past merge into a single tense, leaving three tense distinctions: present, future, past.  These take different marking to indicate their presence in a dependant clause.  The point of reference for these relative tenses is not the moment of speech, but rather the time of the event in the matrix predicate.

## Pronouns

## Verbs

The prototypical verb structure without noun incorporation is a lexical root, an aspect/mood affix, optionally a passive affix, and person-number agreement with the direct object (if one exists).  This is represented by the following template, where <λ> represents the lexical root.

<div class="comparison">
<p>λ-<abbr>ASP:MOD(-PASS)-PNUM:OBJ</abbr></p>
</div>

When a verb involves noun incorporation, the incorporated noun's lexical root (represented by <ƛ> in the following template) appears as a prefix immediately in front of the verb's lexical root, and the person-number agreement is dropped if appropriate (see [Noun Incorporation](#noun-incorporation) for more details).

<div class="comparison">
<p>ƛ-λ-<abbr>ASP:MOD(-PASS)(-PNUM:OBJ)</abbr></p>
</div>

### Aspect/Mood

Verbs in Qʼathebʼo do not inflect for tense (see [Nominal Tense](#tense)), but do have different forms based on the aspect and mood.

#### Perfective

The perfective

#### Imperfective

The imperfective

#### Imperative 

The imperative aspect is used for commands or urgent statements to the listener.  Imperative clauses are almost always succinct, with the subject dropped and objects incorporated.  The implied subject is a second-person pronoun with appropriate number to how many listeners are being addressed, with implied present-tense marking.  This implied subject can be recovered if desired as seen in the expanded sentence %{+3}% below, but such an inclusion of the subject carries a strongly condescending tone (see the [section on commands](#commands) for further discussion).

<p class="number"></p>
<div class="interlinear">
<dl> <dt>aa</dt> <dd>be.careful<abbr>-IMP</abbr></dd> </dl>

## Modifiers

Most modifiers in Qʼathebʼo can modify either nouns or verbs.  When modifying verbs, they occur as bare roots before the verb.  When modifying nouns, they occur after the noun with inflection to agree with the number and class of the noun.
