# Morphology

## Nouns

The prototypical noun structure is a lexical root, a person-number affix based on animacy group, a case affix, and if appropriate a tense affix (usually on nominal-case nouns).  This is represented by the following template, where <λ> represents the lexical root.

<div class="comparison">
<p>λ-<abbr>P.NUM-CASE(-TENSE)</abbr></p>
</div>

### Animacy Groups (Class/Gender)

There a six classes of nouns that determine the noun's declension pattern.  Specifically, a noun's class affects person-number marking, modifier agreement, and word order.

***Group 1*** -- Adult humans, including human body parts and groups of humans (e.g. society).

***Group 2*** -- Animate, self-moving things such as animals, waterfalls, fire, and animal body parts.

***Group 3*** -- Manipulatable objects such as cooked food, tools, small stones, and crops.

***Group 4*** -- Larger environmental objects such as trees, buildings, and clouds.

***Group 5*** -- Abstract, formless things such as thoughts, ideas, and time.

### Person & Number

Nouns always mark number and person, though lower-animacy groups can only mark third person.

### Case

There are nine nominal cases: nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, instrumental, locative, allative, ablative, and essive.  Unlike most nominative-accusative langauges, Qʼathebʼo is a marked accusative language, which means the nominative case takes overt marking while the accusative does not.

### Tense

In Qʼathebʼo sentences, clause-level tense is marked on nominative nouns rather than verbs.  All nouns in the nominative case will mark the tense for the clause.

## Modifiers

Most modifiers in Qʼathebʼo can modify either nouns or verbs.  When modifying verbs, they occur as bare roots before the verb.  When modifying nouns, they occur after the noun with inflection to agree with the number and class of the noun.
