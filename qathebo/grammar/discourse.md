## Commands and Requests

### Commands

Commands create an expectation that the listener perform some action.  These are strong statements that imply some importance, urgency, or authority between the speaker and the listener.

#### Imperative Verb

The most obvious way to create a command is to use a verb in the [Imperative mood](#imperative--o).  This tells the listener that the speaker expects them to do something immediately.

### Requests

Requests convey something the speaker wishes to happen that the listener could help them with.  There is no expectation or obligation that the listener help, merely the suggestion that they could.

#### Optative Verb

One way to make a request is to state the desired situation using an optative verb.  This kind of statement leaves room for the listener to assist in making the statement a reality, based on the context.  The indirect nature of the statement conveys a degree of formality and politeness.

A common use of the optative request is ordering something in a store or restaurant.

<div class="gloss">
<p class="number"></p>
<div class="interlinear">
<dl> <dt>aa-bb-obʼi</dt> <dd>water-drink<abbr>-OPT</abbr></dd> </dl>
<dl> <dt>pʼa-dʼe-bʼi</dt> <dd><abbr>1SG-NOM-PRS</abbr></dd> </dl>
</div>
<p class="freetranslation">"Can I have some water?"</p>
</div>

<div class="gloss">
<p class="number"></p>
<div class="interlinear">
<dl> <dt>aa-obʼi-lo</dt> <dd>buy<abbr>-OPT-G3.PL</abbr></dd> </dl>
<dl> <dt>bʼabʼo-dʼe-bʼi</dt> <dd><abbr>1DU-NOM-PRS</abbr></dd> </dl>
<dl> <dt>dʼotha-la-∅</dt> <dd>rose<abbr>-G3.PL-ACC</abbr></dd> </dl>
<dl> <dt>batha-lo</dt> <dd>ten<abbr>-G3.PL</abbr></dd> </dl>
</div>
<p class="freetranslation">"Can we get ten roses?"</p>
</div>

#### Negated Prohibitive Verb

Another way of forming a request is to negate a verb in the prohibitive mood.  This method is humerous, casual, and even a bit silly as it involves an unnecessary double-negation along the lines of "Don't not do X".  It comes across as somewhat teasing and is often used among friends or family, but would be inappropriate in formal situations or among strangers.

<div class="gloss">
<p class="number"></p>
<div class="interlinear">
<dl> <dt>theni</dt> <dd><abbr>NEG</abbr></dd> </dl>
<dl> <dt>aa-opi-di</dt> <dd>carry<abbr>-PROH-G3.SG</abbr></dd> </dl>
<dl> <dt>pʼa-mo</dt> <dd><abbr>1SG-ALL</abbr></dd> </dl>
<dl> <dt>aa-bb-∅</dt> <dd>book<abbr>-G3.SG-ACC</abbr></dd> </dl>
<dl> <dt>kedi-go</dt> <dd>that<abbr>-G3.SG</abbr></dd> </dl>
</div>
<p class="freetranslation">"Pass me that book."</p>
</div>

It is a cumbersome to use the negated prohibitive in consecutive clauses, so several related requests might start with a negated prohibitive to set the tone then switch to optative requests for subsequent statements, as demonstrated in %{+1}% below.  Note that the implied subject of the prohibitive remains implicit into the second clause.

<div class="gloss">
<p class="number"></p>
<div class="interlinear">
<dl> <dt>theni</dt> <dd><abbr>NEG</abbr></dd> </dl>
<dl> <dt>aa-bb-opa,</dt> <dd>chair-sit<abbr>-PROH</abbr></dd> </dl>
<dl> <dt>aa-obʼi</dt> <dd>emotion.be<abbr>-OPT</abbr></dd> </dl>
<dl> <dt>aa</dt> <dd>relaxed</dd> </dl>
</div>
<p class="freetranslation">"Have a seat, make yourself comfortable."</p>
</div>

### Negative Commands

Negative commands are commands to NOT do something.  They involve a negation of a command as described above.

#### Prohibitive Verb

A verb with prohibitive mood inherently conveys that the listener should not undergo some action.  It carries a neutral tone and could be described as more of a suggestion than an authoritative command.  It lacks the urgency or expectations of a negated imperative.

<div class="gloss">
<p class="number"></p>
<div class="interlinear">
<dl> <dt>theni</dt> <dd><abbr>NEG</abbr></dd> </dl>
</div>
<p class="freetranslation">"Don't stay out too late."</p>
</div>

#### Negated Imperative Verb

An imperative command can be negated to form a negative command.  This has the same strictness, urgency, and potential rudeness as a regular [imperative verb](#imperative--o).  It is only used to emphasize the time-sensative or authoritative nature of the command compared to the basic prohibitive form.

<div class="gloss">
<p class="number"></p>
<div class="interlinear">
<dl> <dt>theni</dt> <dd><abbr>NEG</abbr></dd> </dl>
<dl> <dt>hl-o-di</dt> <dd>eat<abbr>-IMP-G3.SG</abbr></dd> </dl>
<dl> <dt>kedi</dt> <dd>that</dd> </dl>
</div>
<p class="freetranslation">"Don't eat that!"</p>
</div>

<div class="gloss">
<p class="number"></p>
<div class="interlinear">
<dl> <dt>theni</dt> <dd><abbr>NEG</abbr></dd> </dl>
<dl> <dt>qʼath-o</dt> <dd>speak<abbr>-IMP</abbr></dd> </dl>
<dl> <dt>pʼa-ta</dt> <dd><abbr>1SG-DAT</abbr></dd> </dl>
<dl> <dt>qe-dʼe-bʼi</dt> <dd><abbr>2SG-NOM-PRS</abbr></dd> </dl>
</div>
<p class="freetranslation">"Don't speak to me."</p>
</div>

## Expressing Emotions

### Basic Terms

### Bodily Emotions

There are two cultural metaphors that guide how emotions are discussed.  Strong, specific emotions are believed to exist in the throat.  These kinds of emotions are temporary and strong enough to affect someone's actions.  In contrast, weaker emotions reside in the sinuses.  These weak emotions are subtle and imprecise, more of a background feeling that is hard to describe.  The weak emotions can drip back into the throat and eventually become strong emotions, which gave rise to the phrase given in %{+1}% below.

<div class="gloss">
<p class="number"></p>
<div class="interlinear">
<dl> <dt>aa-bb-obʼi</dt> <dd>feelings-release<abbr>-OPT</abbr></dd> </dl>
<dl> <dt>kʼahla</dt> <dd>so.that<abbr></abbr></dd> </dl>
<dl> <dt>theni</dt> <dd><abbr>NEG</abbr></dd> </dl>
<dl> <dt></dt> <dd><abbr></abbr></dd> </dl>
</div>
<p class="freetranslation">"(I hope that) the feelings are released, so that ..."</p>
</div>

This phrase usually appears in the shortened form, and is used after someone sneezes (similar to English "bless you").  It originally conveyed a desire for the weak emotions in the nose to be released before they become overwhelming strong emotions, but the phrase has started to be semantically bleached of its nuanced meaning.
