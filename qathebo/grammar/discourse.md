## Commands and Requests

### Commands

Commands create an expectation that the listener perform some action.  These are strong statements that imply some importance, urgency, or authority between the speaker and the listener.

#### Imperative Verb

The most obvious way to create a command is to use a verb in the [Imperative mood](#imperative--o).  This tells the listener that the speaker expects them to do something immediately.

### Requests

Requests convey something the speaker wishes to happen that the listener could help them with.  There is no expectation or obligation that the listener help, merely the suggestion that they could.

#### Optative Verb

One way to make a request is to state the desired situation using an optative verb.  Depending on the context, this kind of statement leaves room for the listener to assist in making the statement a reality.  The indirect nature of the statement conveys a degree of formality and politeness.

A common use of the optative request is ordering something in a store or restaurant.

## Expressing Emotions

### Basic Terms

### Bodily Emotions

There are two cultural metaphors that guide how emotions are discussed.  Strong, specific emotions are believed to exist in the throat.  These kinds of emotions are temporary and strong enough to affect someone's actions.  In contrast, weaker emotions reside in the sinuses.  These weak emotions are subtle and imprecise, more of a background feeling that is hard to describe.  The weak emotions can drip back into the throat and eventually become strong emotions, which gave rise to the phrase given in %{+1}% below.

<div class="gloss">
<p class="number"></p>
<div class="interlinear">
<dl> <dt>aa-bb-obʼi</dt> <dd>feelings-release<abbr>-OPT</abbr></dd> </dl>
<dl> <dt>kʼahla</dt> <dd>so.that<abbr></abbr></dd> </dl>
<dl> <dt>theni</dt> <dd><abbr>NEG</abbr></dd> </dl>
<dl> <dt></dt> <dd><abbr></abbr></dd> </dl>
</div>
<p class="freetranslation">"(I hope that) the feelings are released, so that ..."</p>
</div>

This phrase usually appears in the shortened form, and is used after someone sneezes (similar to English "bless you").  It originally conveyed a desire for the weak emotions in the nose to be released before they become overwhelming strong emotions, but the phrase has started to be semantically bleached of its nuanced meaning.
