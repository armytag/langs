### Bodily Emotions

There are two cultural metaphors that guide how emotions are discussed.  Strong, specific emotions are believed to exist in the throat.  These kinds of emotions are temporary and strong enough to affect someone's actions.  In contrast, weaker emotions reside in the sinuses.  These weak emotions are subtle and imprecise, more of a background feeling that is hard to describe.  The weak emotions can drip back into the throat and eventually become strong emotions, which gave rise to the phrase given in %{+1}% below.

<div class="gloss">
<p class="number"></p>
<div class="interlinear">
<dl> <dt>aa-bb-obʼi</dt> <dd>feelings-release<abbr>-OPT</abbr></dd> </dl>
<dl> <dt>kʼahla</dt> <dd>so.that<abbr></abbr></dd> </dl>
<dl> <dt>theni</dt> <dd><abbr>NEG</abbr></dd> </dl>
<dl> <dt></dt> <dd><abbr></abbr></dd> </dl>
</div>
<p class="freetranslation">"(I hope that) the feelings are released, so that ..."</p>
</div>

This phrase usually appears in the shortened form, and is used after someone sneezes (similar to English "bless you").  It originally conveyed a desire for the weak emotions in the nose to be released before they become overwhelming strong emotions, but the phrase has started to be semantically bleached of its nuanced meaning.
