# Syntax

## Relative Clauses

## Expressing Time

### Temporal Subordinate Clauses

To express an event that occurs at some time relative to another primary event, the verb of the subordinate event moves to the end of the subordinate clause, and the subordinate verb and noun take special aspect and tense marking.

### Phasal Polarity

Phasal polarity is the expression of a change in situation between two points in time.  This is typically grouped into four arrangements, two of which compare the current situation to a prior state and two of which compare the current state to a later state.  When comparing to a prior situation, the term *ALREADY* is used when the current situation has something the prior situation does not (as in "He is *already* asleep") while the term *NO LONGER* is used when the current situation doesn't have some quality that the prior situation had (as in "He is *no longer* asleep").  When comparing to a subsequent situation, the term *STILL* is used when the current situation has some quality that the subsequent situation will not (as in "He is *still* asleep (but won't be later)") and the term *NOT YET* is used when the current situation lacks a quality that the subsequent situation will have (as in "He is *not yet* asleep (but will be later)").  These common distinctions are summarized in the table below, where a '+' indicates the presence of some quality at that point in time and a '-' indicates a lack of the quality at that point in time.

| Term        | Prior Time | Current Time | Subsequent Time |
| ---         | :---:      | :---:        | :---:           |
| *ALREADY*   | -          | +            |                 |
| *NO LONGER* | +          | -            |                 |
| *STILL*     |            | +            | -               |
| *NOT YET*   |            | -            | +               |
: Types of Phasal Polarity

In Qʼathebʼo, each of these phasal polarity distinctions are expressed in multiple ways depending on the lexical and aspectual qualities of the predicate.
