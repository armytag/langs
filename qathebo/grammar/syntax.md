# Syntax

## Basic Word Order

Independant clauses follow a somewhat strict word order.  The predicate verb occurs at the beginning of the sentence, preceded by adverbs and succeeded by verb-modifiers.  After that, the noun phrases occur in the order of the animacy groups from Group 1 to Group 5.  Noun modifiers, including relative clauses modifying nouns, directly follow the noun they modify.

Personal pronouns usually occur before other Group 1 nouns.  First-person and second-person pronouns can occur in any order relative to each other, as sentences %{+1}% and %{+2}% demonstrate.  However, third-person pronouns always occur after the other two; sentence %{+3}% would be considered ungrammatical.

## Relative Clauses

Relative clauses are predicates that are being used to modify part of another clause (known as the matrix clause).  These predicates contain everything a regular clause would contain, but typically take different tense or aspect marking and appear verb-finally rather than verb-initially.  When affecting the other clause as a whole, they appear before the matrix verb as seen in sentence %{+1}% below.  When affecting a noun, they appear after the matrix noun and begin with the relativizer *da* as seen in sentence %{+2}% below.

## Expressing Time

### Temporal Subordinate Clauses

To express an event that occurs at some time relative to another primary event, the verb of the subordinate event moves to the end of the subordinate clause, and the subordinate verb and noun take special aspect and tense marking.

### Phasal Polarity

Phasal polarity is the expression of a change in situation between two points in time.  This is typically grouped into four arrangements, two of which compare the current situation to a prior state and two of which compare the current state to a later state.  When comparing to a prior situation, the term *ALREADY* is used when the current situation has something the prior situation does not (as in "He is *already* asleep") while the term *NO LONGER* is used when the current situation doesn't have some quality that the prior situation had (as in "He is *no longer* asleep").  When comparing to a subsequent situation, the term *STILL* is used when the current situation has some quality that the subsequent situation will not (as in "He is *still* asleep (but won't be later)") and the term *NOT YET* is used when the current situation lacks a quality that the subsequent situation will have (as in "He is *not yet* asleep (but will be later)").  These common distinctions are summarized in the table below, where a '+' indicates the presence of some quality at that point in time and a '-' indicates a lack of the quality at that point in time.

| Term        | Prior Time | Current Time | Subsequent Time |
| ---         | :---:      | :---:        | :---:           |
| *ALREADY*   | -          | +            |                 |
| *NO LONGER* | +          | -            |                 |
| *STILL*     |            | +            | -               |
| *NOT YET*   |            | -            | +               |
: Types of Phasal Polarity

In Qʼathebʼo, each of these phasal polarity distinctions are expressed in multiple ways depending on the lexical and aspectual qualities of the predicate.

#### Perfective Verb

Perfective verbs inherently convey a neutral sense of *ALREADY* by focusing on the start or end of an action.

#### Imperfective Verb

Imperfective verbs with stative or locational arguments inherently convey a neutral sense of *STILL* by focusing on the duration of the predicate.

When such verbs are negated with *theni*, the inherent timing changes to *NO LONGER*.

#### Adverb *bʼaqa*

The adverb *bʼaqa* ("yet") is used to convey counterfactual *STILL*, emphasizing that the present situation has not changed despite some expectation or desire that it be otherwise.  This is much stronger than a lone perfective verb, which carries only a weak implication of *STILL*.

When *bʼaqa* is used with a negated verb, it gains the meaning of *NOT YET*, emphasizing that the present situation lacks some expected or desired quality.
