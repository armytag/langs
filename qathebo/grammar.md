## Phonological Constraints

# Nouns

## Morphology

### Animacy Groups (Class/Gender)

There a six classes of nouns that determine the noun's declension pattern.  Specifically, a noun's class affects person-number marking, modifier agreement, and word order.

### Person & Number

Nouns always mark number and person, though lower-animacy groups can only mark third person.

### Case

There are nine nominal cases: nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, instrumental, locative, allative, ablative, and essive.  Unlike most nominative-accusative langauges, Qʼathebʼo is a marked accusative language, which means the nominative case takes overt marking while the accusative does not.

### Tense

In Qʼathebʼo sentences, clause-level tense is marked on nominative nouns rather than verbs.  All nouns in the nominative case will mark the tense for the clause.

## Pronouns

# Verbs

# Modifiers

Most modifiers in Qʼathebʼo can modify either nouns or verbs.  When modifying verbs, they occur as bare roots before the verb.  When modifying nouns, they occur after the noun with inflection to agree with the number and class of the noun.

# Syntax

## Relative Clauses

## Expressing Time

### Temporal Subordinate Clauses

To express an event that occurs at some time relative to another primary event, the verb of the subordinate event moves to the end of the subordinate clause, and the subordinate verb and noun take special aspect and tense marking.

### Phasal Polarity

Simple phasal polarity can be expressed through dedicated temporal adverbs.
