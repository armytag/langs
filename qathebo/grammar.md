## Diachronic Vowel Analysis

This section outlines a proposed sequence of sound changes that can explain the modern Qʼathebʼo vowel system, including its assimilation rules.  It seems that at some prior point, Qʼathebʼo likely had a simple three vowel system with the cardinal vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/ occuring independantly and in roughly equal fequency.  Eventually the vowels started to assimilate according to the antecedant vowel, with /u/ undergoing extensive change, leading ultimately to the current Qʼathebʼo four-vowel system.  This process appears to have occurred in the following stages, ordered from earliest to most recent:

1. Lowering of high vowels before /a/: i → ɛ / \_Ca
1. Centralization of back vowels before /i/: a → ɛ / \_Ci
1. Dissimilation of high back vowel: o → ɛ / \_Co
