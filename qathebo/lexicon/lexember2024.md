# Day 2 -- TOUCHING GRASS

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to step outside and get some fresh air. You don’t have to go on a 12 hour hike if you don’t want to, but you should at least let yourself feel the wind in your hair or the sun on your skin for at least a couple minutes, weather permitting.

What’s the weather like where you are? Is it sunny, overcast, windy, raining, stormy? What kind of plants and animals live around your home? Do you live in a shady forest or barren desert, a windswept plain or out on the water?

Tell us about the grass you touched today!

# Day 3 -- EATING GOOD

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to make yourself your favourite meal. It doesn’t have to be healthy for you, it just has to make you feel good. Food for the soul, not for the body.

What are you eating? Are you eating in or out? Is it something your mother always made for you growing up, or is it a food you discovered only recently? Is it sweet, savoury, something else?

Tell us about what you ate today!

# Day 4 -- SHOWING GRATITUDE

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to consider some of the things in your life that you’re thankful for. It can be something as small and mundane as being thankful for the food that you get to eat, or something greater.

What are you thankful for? Is it something someone has done for you or given you? Is there even anyone in the world to direct your gratitude towards? What can you do to show your gratitude?

Tell us about what you’re grateful for today!

# Day 5 -- DREAMING

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to pay some attention to the fantastic imagery conjured up by your subconscious each night. Often as we try to recall a dream, it slips through our grasp, intangible and nonsensical. Some people say they don’t dream, or dream very rarely, but, unless your sleep is disrupted in some way, you do dream but likely forget it all. A technique for better remembering dreams is to go over what you can recall in your mind first thing after waking up, ideally even before you open your eyes. Dream journaling helps too. That said, I don’t expect you all to have a particular dream on hand for this activity. You have my permission to make something up, or to come back to this tomorrow after you’ve visited again that strange other world within.

But whatever dreams you recall or invent, let these inspire your words today. You may remember a dream from last night, or a dream from long ago that was important to you—perhaps you’ve even had a dream that seemed prophetic? Or maybe you have a recurring dream or nightmare. Whatever the case, coin words for things you’ve experienced in these dreams, or coin words about dreams themselves, perhaps different kinds or characteristics. For worldbuilding, this is also an opportunity to think about what dreams are to your conpeople.

Tell us about what you dreamed last night, or any night!

# Day 6 -- LEAVING A TOKEN

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to give a small token of appreciation to a friend and let them know you appreciate them. Feel good by making someone else feel good.

Who are you giving your token to? A parent, sibling, or child? A long time friend you haven’t caught up with in a while, or a new friend you haven’t told you appreciate yet? What are you giving as your token? Is it something you made with your own two hands, a new game, a bite to eat, or a comforting hot drink?

Tell us about who you’re appreciating today and the token you used to let them know!

# Day 7 -- FEELING LIKE A KID AGAIN

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to do something that you did in your childhood, something that makes you recall what it was like to see the world through young eyes.

What was something you did as a kid? Did you run as fast as you could to see if you could outrun the flying swans? Did you climb trees at every opportunity? Did you go turning over rocks to look for bugs? Did you paint or draw and hang your creations in the kitchen? Did you do cartwheels until you couldn’t walk straight?

Tell us about how you made yourself feel like a kid today!

# Day 8 -- MEDITATING

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to take a moment to sit with your thoughts. Remove any distractions, sit in a comfortable position, and let your thoughts meander as they will. Let yourself feel any emotions that you feel, or remember any memories that you recall, even if they’re uncomfortable, you can accept and acknowledge them and move on.

Where are you meditating? Somewhere comfy and all your own like your bed, or maybe somewhere out in nature? Where did your thoughts lead you, what emotions did you feel? Did you have to acknowledge any sour memories, or did you feel comforted by some feel-good memories?

Tell us about your meditation today!

# Day 9 -- COMPLIMENTING YOURSELF

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to focus on something you like about yourself! We humans have a tendency to focus on the negatives in life, because it serves the evolutionary purpose of making us more alert and cautious and thus more likely to survive. All too often we tend to get caught up in all the things we want to improve or change, or that we straight up dislike about ourselves. But now it’s time to show yourself some appreciation!

What is something you like about yourself? Is it physical or not? Is there a skill that you’re particularly good at? Is there something about your appearance that you just really like? Is your hair always flawless? Do you always bake the best cakes? Do you always attract attention on the dance floor?

Tell us about how you’ve praised yourself today!

# Day 10 -- REVISITING A FAVORITE WORK OF FICTION

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to go back to a story you love and enjoy a part of it again. It could be a passage from a beloved novel, an episode of a series you enjoy, a treasured poem, or anything else.

What kind of work is it? What’s it about, or what are the themes? What do you love about it? Does it remind you of anything in your life? These are all things you could coin words to talk about. You could even translate a sentence or passage from the work.

Share something you love with us today!

# Day 11 -- MOVING AND GROOVING

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to get your body moving to some of your favourite music. You could play some guilty pleasure dance pop and bust out all your most embarrassing moves like no one’s watching, you could grab a partner and tango in elegance, or you could play pump-it-up tunes and train for that sporting event you got coming up.

What music are you listening to, what genre? How are you moving and grooving? Are you dancing or sporting? What kind of dancing or sporting?

Tell us about how you moved and grooved today!

# Day 12 -- GETTING COZY

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to activate burrito mode. Make yourself a hot drink, get a nice snack, make a comfy nest, and roll yourself up in whatever is comfiest for you, and just relax. You could take a nap, careful to not spill anything, or you could watch a comfort show, read a book, or catch up with a friend also getting cozy.

Where are you getting cozy? Your bed, on the couch, somewhere else? What drinks or snacks did you get yourself? How are you enjoying the comfiness? Ddi you watch a show or read a book? If you’re in warmer climes, how did you make the vibes cozy if burrito mode would be too warm?

Tell us about how you got cozy today!
