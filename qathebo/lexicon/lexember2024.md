# Day 2 -- TOUCHING GRASS

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to step outside and get some fresh air. You don’t have to go on a 12 hour hike if you don’t want to, but you should at least let yourself feel the wind in your hair or the sun on your skin for at least a couple minutes, weather permitting.

What’s the weather like where you are? Is it sunny, overcast, windy, raining, stormy? What kind of plants and animals live around your home? Do you live in a shady forest or barren desert, a windswept plain or out on the water?

Tell us about the grass you touched today!

# Day 3 -- EATING GOOD

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to make yourself your favourite meal. It doesn’t have to be healthy for you, it just has to make you feel good. Food for the soul, not for the body.

What are you eating? Are you eating in or out? Is it something your mother always made for you growing up, or is it a food you discovered only recently? Is it sweet, savoury, something else?

Tell us about what you ate today!

# Day 4 -- SHOWING GRATITUDE

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to consider some of the things in your life that you’re thankful for. It can be something as small and mundane as being thankful for the food that you get to eat, or something greater.

What are you thankful for? Is it something someone has done for you or given you? Is there even anyone in the world to direct your gratitude towards? What can you do to show your gratitude?

Tell us about what you’re grateful for today!

# Day 5 -- DREAMING

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to pay some attention to the fantastic imagery conjured up by your subconscious each night. Often as we try to recall a dream, it slips through our grasp, intangible and nonsensical. Some people say they don’t dream, or dream very rarely, but, unless your sleep is disrupted in some way, you do dream but likely forget it all. A technique for better remembering dreams is to go over what you can recall in your mind first thing after waking up, ideally even before you open your eyes. Dream journaling helps too. That said, I don’t expect you all to have a particular dream on hand for this activity. You have my permission to make something up, or to come back to this tomorrow after you’ve visited again that strange other world within.

But whatever dreams you recall or invent, let these inspire your words today. You may remember a dream from last night, or a dream from long ago that was important to you—perhaps you’ve even had a dream that seemed prophetic? Or maybe you have a recurring dream or nightmare. Whatever the case, coin words for things you’ve experienced in these dreams, or coin words about dreams themselves, perhaps different kinds or characteristics. For worldbuilding, this is also an opportunity to think about what dreams are to your conpeople.

Tell us about what you dreamed last night, or any night!

# Day 6 -- LEAVING A TOKEN

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to give a small token of appreciation to a friend and let them know you appreciate them. Feel good by making someone else feel good.

Who are you giving your token to? A parent, sibling, or child? A long time friend you haven’t caught up with in a while, or a new friend you haven’t told you appreciate yet? What are you giving as your token? Is it something you made with your own two hands, a new game, a bite to eat, or a comforting hot drink?

Tell us about who you’re appreciating today and the token you used to let them know!

# Day 7 -- FEELING LIKE A KID AGAIN

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to do something that you did in your childhood, something that makes you recall what it was like to see the world through young eyes.

What was something you did as a kid? Did you run as fast as you could to see if you could outrun the flying swans? Did you climb trees at every opportunity? Did you go turning over rocks to look for bugs? Did you paint or draw and hang your creations in the kitchen? Did you do cartwheels until you couldn’t walk straight?

Tell us about how you made yourself feel like a kid today!

# Day 8 -- MEDITATING

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to take a moment to sit with your thoughts. Remove any distractions, sit in a comfortable position, and let your thoughts meander as they will. Let yourself feel any emotions that you feel, or remember any memories that you recall, even if they’re uncomfortable, you can accept and acknowledge them and move on.

Where are you meditating? Somewhere comfy and all your own like your bed, or maybe somewhere out in nature? Where did your thoughts lead you, what emotions did you feel? Did you have to acknowledge any sour memories, or did you feel comforted by some feel-good memories?

Tell us about your meditation today!

# Day 9 -- COMPLIMENTING YOURSELF

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to focus on something you like about yourself! We humans have a tendency to focus on the negatives in life, because it serves the evolutionary purpose of making us more alert and cautious and thus more likely to survive. All too often we tend to get caught up in all the things we want to improve or change, or that we straight up dislike about ourselves. But now it’s time to show yourself some appreciation!

What is something you like about yourself? Is it physical or not? Is there a skill that you’re particularly good at? Is there something about your appearance that you just really like? Is your hair always flawless? Do you always bake the best cakes? Do you always attract attention on the dance floor?

Tell us about how you’ve praised yourself today!

# Day 10 -- REVISITING A FAVORITE WORK OF FICTION

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to go back to a story you love and enjoy a part of it again. It could be a passage from a beloved novel, an episode of a series you enjoy, a treasured poem, or anything else.

What kind of work is it? What’s it about, or what are the themes? What do you love about it? Does it remind you of anything in your life? These are all things you could coin words to talk about. You could even translate a sentence or passage from the work.

Share something you love with us today!

# Day 11 -- MOVING AND GROOVING

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to get your body moving to some of your favourite music. You could play some guilty pleasure dance pop and bust out all your most embarrassing moves like no one’s watching, you could grab a partner and tango in elegance, or you could play pump-it-up tunes and train for that sporting event you got coming up.

What music are you listening to, what genre? How are you moving and grooving? Are you dancing or sporting? What kind of dancing or sporting?

Tell us about how you moved and grooved today!

# Day 12 -- GETTING COZY

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to activate burrito mode. Make yourself a hot drink, get a nice snack, make a comfy nest, and roll yourself up in whatever is comfiest for you, and just relax. You could take a nap, careful to not spill anything, or you could watch a comfort show, read a book, or catch up with a friend also getting cozy.

Where are you getting cozy? Your bed, on the couch, somewhere else? What drinks or snacks did you get yourself? How are you enjoying the comfiness? Ddi you watch a show or read a book? If you’re in warmer climes, how did you make the vibes cozy if burrito mode would be too warm?

Tell us about how you got cozy today!

# Day 13 -- LIGHTING A CANDLE

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to turn off the lights and light a candle. It doesn’t have to be an actual candle, any little light source will do. Be silent, listen, and reflect on how the contrast between light and darkness makes you feel. If you’re using a candle or some other heat-producing thing, hold it in your hands and feel its warmth. The liminal feeling that arises as you stare into a flame in an otherwise completely dark place, can be quite uncanny, forcing you to perceive your surroundings in a new way.

What kind of light source are you using? Is it electrical or not? How does it make you feel? Anxious by the darkness? Comforted by the light? Somewhere in-between? What kinds of sounds do you hear?

Tell us about your experience lighting a candle today!

# Day 14 -- MAKING AND CREATING

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to get creative and make something. You can make it as a gift for someone or even for yourself, but it doesn’t matter what you make: the only thing that matters is that you’re making something for the joy of being creative. You could paint a masterpiece or draw a silly comic, you could break out some garbage and hot glue or a wedge of clay and a spinning wheel, or you could whip out a pen and some lined paper or your guitar and a blank tab sheet; you could even load up a Minecraft world. Just be creative and have fun with it!

What are you making? Is it in a medium you work with a lot? Are you dusting off an old hobby, or engaging in a new one? Are you making just to make, or do you have a recipient in mind for the gift you’re making?

Tell us about what you made today!

# Day 15 -- APOLOGIZING

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to be the bigger man and make amends for something. Let your guilt go and ask for forgiveness. It doesn’t matter how big or small the thing is you’re asking forgiveness for, or how recent it was. You could apologize for how heated an argument with your partner got the other day, or you could finally let go of that innocuous sleight years ago nobody but you remembers. In any case, make future you feel good by getting rid of some bad blood.

Who are you apologising to? What are you apologizing for? How are apologizing? Just sincere words, or are gonna bake an “I’m sorry!” cake? What kind of tact do you feel you need, if any?

Tell us about how you apologized today!

# Day 16 -- SHOWING FORGIVENESS

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to show forgiveness to someone for something. You could forgive yourself for something you’ve been hard on yourself for, or maybe you could finally let go of a grudge you’ve held against a friend for a long time, or even realise a parent was simply trying their best raising you, even if it traumatised you. You’re welcome to tell whoever you’re forgiving that you’re forgiving them, but you don’t have to: the important thing is to let go of those negative emotions you might be feeling towards whatever transgression you’re forgiving.

Who are you forgiving? Is it yourself, a friend, a family member? Maybe it’s someone who doesn’t even know who you are. What did you forgive them for? Did you forgive yourself for failing an important assessment, or your best friend who shared a secret that wasn’t theirs to tell, or an aunt who ruined your wedding?

Tell us about how you showed forgiveness today! 

# Day 17 -- TRADING SHOES

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to put yourself in someone else’s shoes. Try and think on their needs and how they see the world; try to understand their needs and where those needs come from. At the same time, try and see yourself through their eyes, try and see what areas of your life someone else might see you neglect for one reason or another. The goal of this exercise is to build empathy both for a loved one and for yourself so you can better both their and your own needs, not that you need take care of those needs right away, only just recognise them.

Whose shoes are putting yourself in; whose eyes are you looking through? Is it a close friend you’re going through a rough patch with, or is it a dependent family member like a child or aging parent? What needs do you now recognise in them and yourself?

Tell us about the empathy you built today! 

# Day 18 -- EATING HEARTY

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to have something nutritious to eat! Something that’s really going to fuel your body and heart and keep you warm!

What is hearty to you? Does it involve meat? Beans? Is it a simmered stew full of tubers or is it something roasted in the oven? Is it even possible to define what it means for a dish to be hearty…?

Tell us about what you strengthened yourself with today! 

# Day 19 -- LOOKING FOR AN EVERGREEN

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to go find your nearest evergreen. If you have a christmas tree or some mistletoe inside, these don’t count: you’ll have to leave the house, weather permitting. Pull on some boots and shrug on all the extra layers you need and get to searching. Make sure to appreciate the evergreen, feel its bark or its leaves, admire the sharp green hue, and if you feel so inclined, take a small clipping home with you to brighten your space. Make sure to leave something behind for the faeries if you do take a clipping!
How far did you have to go to find your evergreen? What kind of evergreen is it? What does it smell like, what does it feel like? Did you bring a partner to kiss under the mistletoe? If you took a small clipping, what tool did you use, what token did you leave behind, and where did you set it in your home?

Tell us about the evergreen you found today! 

# Day 20 -- SINGING LIKE NOBODY’S LISTENING

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to express yourself and your voice. Pick your favourite song, something you know the words to, and give it your all singing through the whole thing. Don’t hold back! If the folks around you won’t mind, ignore them; if they do, find a space where you can sing your heart out, or find better friends/family and invite them to sing with you!

What song are you singing; what genre does it belong to? Is it a song you’ve liked for as long as you can remember, or is it a new find you absolutely cannot get out of your head? Are you singing in your room, out with friends, or to the trees?

Tell us about how you sang like nobody’s listening today! 

# Day 21 -- TAKING A HOT BATH

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to treat yourself to a spa day. Fill up the tub with water that’s just the right temperature, and get some epsom salts or bath bombs if you’re into that. You can set the ambiance just how you like with music or candles, and you can treat yourself with some bath snacks and a glass of wine or sparkling juice, or, better yet, get your partner to bring them to you. Be careful with open flames, and careful not to drop your snacks or a book in the water.

How are you dressing your tub? Do you like your bathwater scalding or lukewarm? What scents do you like in your salts or bath bombs? What snacks did you bring to the bath with you? What kind of music are you listening to or what kind of book are you reading?

Tell us about the bath you took today!

# Day 22 -- BUILDING A FIRE

## Prompt

Today we’d like you to roll it back and get warm and toasty the old-fashioned, your situation permitting. Go chop some firewood, shave some kindling, and/or build a tipi, log cabin, or whatever other way you may once learned to start a fire, and get to burning. Revel in your human ability to create fire with your own two hands. Be sure to keep some snacks and blankets handy, too, and you could even try making a hot cup of cocoa over your fire.

How are you building your fire? Do you have to make a firepit, or do you already have a fire bowl or fireplace handy? Are you starting the fire with friction, a flint and steel, or a lighter? What kind of wood are you burning? Are you making anything to eat/drink over the fire? What shapes do you see dancing in the fire?

Tell us about the fire you built today!
