# Speakers and Conworld

My language will be spoken (originally) by a group of humans living near a major volcanic mountain.  Their environment is heavily inspired by the island of Madagascar.  The first script is developed by astronomers working/living in caves up in the mountains.

The speakers have typical human physiology, meaning they have two arms and hands, two legs and feet, a torso, and a head.  They have two eyes, two ears, one mouth, and one nose.  They have dense hair on their heads, armpits, and crotch, with smaller hairs on their arms and legs.  Men also have hair on their face and chest, which is thicker and bushier than the average human man.  The speakers have skin on the darker side.  They move around their environment by walking, running, climbing, and occasionally swimming.

The original speakers of the language lived in a valley in the foothills of a lone volcanic mountain.  A river runs through the valley, large enough to support some urbanization but still close enough to the mountain source that it isn't overly wide yet.  It's mostly a tropical dry forest biome with seasonal rains causing a long dry and long wet period, which has a major effect on the kinds of flora and fauna in the region.
