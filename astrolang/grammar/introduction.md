# Introduction

## Goal

I want to create a language inspired by ancient Egyptian and classical Mayan, with a major focus on spatio-temporal relationships and valency operations.

## Intended Audience and Media:

My documentation will take the form of markdown files that can be turned into HTML or PDF for distribution.  I may suppliment this with some written work in a notebook, but I should digitize any physical notes on a regular basis.

I hope to share progress in the conlang through simple social media posts.  These should involve some cute examples of some part of the language, and have minimal written description.
