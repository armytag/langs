1. Suffix form used with possession phrases, prepositional phrases, and ergative constructions.
1. Independant form used for absolutive constructions and appearing as suffix form with additional final consonant.
1. Stressed form used for topicalization ("It is X who verbs") and consisting of a common disyllabic root with ending depending on person.
