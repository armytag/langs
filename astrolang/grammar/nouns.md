# Nouns

- Classes for sapient (from "wise") vs non-sapient (from "tool")
    - Sapient include humans, gods/spirits, and leopards
    - Could this evolve from some sort of honorific system (i.e. those of equal or higher intelligence to me)?
        - Honorific form could be more periphrastic
- Singular vs Plural distinction
    - Singular originally unmarked
    - Plural from *cunaki* → *co* "people" for humans, from *sumi* → *si* "all" for non-sapients
- Definite articles develop between Protolang and Early Astrolang
    - Definiteness marked with fusional affix in Protolang
        - Definite from earlier demonstrative (*ʃuti* → *ci* "that")
        - Indefinite normally unmarked
        - Indefinite sapient plural from earlier *cunaki ʔupa* → *cokʼop* "one people"
    - Definiteness marked with articles in Early Astrolang
- Nominal functions indicated through word order (VOS) or directionals with relational nouns (instead of adpositions)
    - In Protolang core functions like Ergative, Absolutive, and Genitive marked with case endings; when final vowels drop, these are replaced with separate articles
