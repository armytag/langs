# Nouns

## Noun Morphology

### Class

Nouns have two declension patters or "classes".  The first class generally includes nouns with high intelligence or agency such as humans, gods/spirits, and leopards.  The other class includes all other nouns including livestock, plants, tools, and so on.

(Animate nouns could also involve some sort of periphrastic honorific system i.e. those of equal or higher intelligence to me)

### Number

Nouns can occur in singular or plural form.  The singular is unmarked.  The plural form is different depending on whether the nouns is in the Animate class or the Inanimate class.  The Animate plural derives from *cunaki* ("people") which simplified into *co*.  The Inanimate plural derives from *sumi* ("many") which simplified into *si*.

### Definiteness

Definite marking comes from an old demonstrative *ʃuti* ("that") which simplified into *ci* and fused onto the definite noun after the plural marking.

For Animate nouns, the plural form took a different indefinite marking *ʔupa* ("one") which combined with *cunaki* ("people") to form the indefinite plural suffix *-cokʼupa*.

### Noun functions

In Protolang the syntactic roles of nouns were marked by particles that preceded the noun, but have since affixed to the adjacent noun.  The Ergative particle *pi* has attached as a prefix. However, genetive particle *tʼa* has fused onto the **preceding** noun as a suffix, creating a construct state within genitive constructions where the (anterior) head noun is inflected rather than the (posterior) modifying noun.

## Relational Nouns

Instead of adpositions (though a few do exist), Astrolang primarily uses relational nouns to convey how nouns are related to one another.

- *kasnét* "head of" → up/above
- *lacót* "neck of" → at (unenclosed)
- *nipót* "flank/side of" → beside
- *siwót* "eye of" → front
- *sokát* "belly of" → inside (enclosed)
- *tapét* "foot of" → down/below
- *tocát* "hand of" → have (possession)
- *túhét* "back of" → behind
- *wowát* "heart of" → between (?)

>*\[lit\] sec lacót sásac*
>\[sleep\] leopard neck_of tree.DEF
>"A leopard sleeps in the tree"

- directionals (adpositions)
    - "to see" → toward
    - "surround" → around

## Pronouns

### Personal Pronouns

Personal pronouns have several forms:

1. Suffix form used with possession phrases, prepositional phrases, and absolutive constructions.
1. Independant form used for ergative constructions and appears as suffix form with additional final consonant.
1. Stressed form used for topicalization ("It is X who verbs") and consisting of a common disyllabic root with ending depending on person.
